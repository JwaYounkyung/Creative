"Semitic agreement is normally discontinuous (i.e. expressed by more than one affix on the verb) only in the second and third persons. However, in restricted cases in particular languages, first person agreement is also discontinuous. I discuss two types of first person discontinuities. The first manifests the hallmarks of a meta split, persisting across paradigms and exponents. I argue that this type of first person discontinuity arises due to postsyntactic Fission which separates antagonistic sets of features prior to insertion and which is driven by markedness constraints on feature coexponence. The second type of first person discontinuity is restricted to a single paradigm and does not evince true discontinuous bleeding effects. Such discontinuities are best captured via morphological Doubling, modeled via Generalized Reduplication. First person discontinuities thus provide strong empirical support for the autonomy of morpheme splitting rules and morpheme copying rules. I demonstrate that each type of rule has a distinct empirical signature and acts as a repair to a different kind of morphotactic constraint. Consequently, there must be more than one route to discontinuous agreement.",0
"Dressler et al. (2019, https://www.italian-journal-linguistics.com/app/uploads/2021/05/3_Dressler.pdf) report several cases of rather unusual patterns in children's morphological acquisition and suggest that these patterns pose challenges to both usage-based and universalist theories of language acquisition. We argue that a learning-theoretic account of how such patterns might emerge is missing from current theories, and show that the Tolerance Principle (Yang, 2016) provides such an account. We apply the Tolerance Principle to both types of ""blind-alley developments"" discussed by Dressler et al. and show that it successfully accounts for these patterns as transient mismatches between form and function during acquisition.",0

"The dissertation examines a wide range of phenomena from the perspective of the NP/DP-language distinction, establishing a number of novel typological generalizations, and discussing their relevance to various aspects of the linguistic theory.
Bošković originally proposed a two-way distinction of NP/DP-languages, namely languages with and without definite articles, but Talić (2017) argued that the two-way distinction is not sufficient, with a three-way distinction needed: article-less languages, affixal article languages, and non-affixal article languages. In this dissertation, I first provide additional support for Talić's proposal with two novel typological generalizations: extraction of a conjunct from coordinate structures may be allowed only in affixal article and article-less languages, and what I call compositional indeterminate pronouns may be productive only in languages with affixal articles and without articles. Relatedly to the second generalization, I establish the generalization that large-scale pied-piping is possible in a language only if it has compositional indeterminate pronouns and the projection to be pied-piped is head-final. I also offer deductions of these generalizations, which have consequences for a number of phenomena/mechanisms, e.g. with respect to phases, Agree, labeling, and the syntax of wh-in-situ. Regarding Agree, I argue that it can be deduced from Minimal Search, hence eliminated from the grammar.
Most importantly, I argue that Talić's three-way distinction of NP/DP-languages is not sufficient either; we need a more fine-grained ""scale"" of NP/DP-language distinction, from canonical to non-canonical DP languages, rather than a two-way or a three-way ""cut"". I demonstrate that a number of languages (e.g. Italian and Greek) that have been treated as canonical DP-languages by Bošković and Talić exhibit some properties of NP-languages, and argue that the presence/absence of a definite article does not necessarily correspond to the presence/absence of DP in a given language or a construction. I propose that the definite article has an option of not projecting DP, by being base-generated adjoined to another head in the nominal domain, an option which I show enables us to capture the scale of DP-hood. I also show that the scale approach to the NP/DP-language distinction is an appropriate point of parameterization in minimalism.",1
"Scottish Gaelic uses nominalizations of verbs in the construction of various non-finite clauses. These nominalizations look morphologically much like English deverbal nominals of the destruction/refusal/engagement kind: their form is idiosyncratic to the root, and they have all the properties of nominals, including, in Gaelic, grammatical gender. However, the Gaelic nominalizations behave syntactically, in non-finite clauses, just as though they are verbs, rejecting nominal modifiers. I argue that they really are verbal in such circumstances, and that their peculiar behaviour can be explained if nominalization may take place either syntactically (for the case where they behave like nouns) or on the way to spellout `in' the morphology (for the case where they behave like verbs), drawing on the idea of Parallel Morphology proposed by Borer (1988).",0
"An often discussed dimension of the locality conditions on allomorphy is visibility: when do the trigger and target of allomorphy 'see' each other? An equally important dimension is intervention: when do the trigger and target stop seeing each other? Through the lens of a detailed analysis of Greek verbal morphology, this paper examines the conditions under which intervention forces the insertion of a default exponent. On the basis of two case studies on affixal allomorphy and one on stem allomorphy, I argue that patterns of intervention are easily accommodated under adjacency-based theories of the locality of allomorphy, and mysterious under less restrictive alternatives.",0
"This chapter shows that Asturian middle-passive contexts containing certain activity verbs, such as 'lleer' (to read), as well as a relational or body-part noun as their grammatical subject allow for the insertion of a non-selected dative argument necessarily interpreted as the inalienable possessor of such noun. Moreover, two configurations can yield these structures: one where the dative phrase raises to preverbal subject position from inside TP, and another where the dative DP is left-dislocated and the theme in subject position. Interestingly, an analysis relying on the notion of low applicative heads relating the possessor and the possessee cannot successfully account for these configurations due to intervention effects when both the dative DP and the grammatical subject occur preverbally. Instead, an approach whereby the inalienable possession construal arises inside the DP–theme and subsequently spreads to the applicative head that introduces the dative possessor successfully overcomes this shortcoming.",0
"We review accounts of the generalization from Zwicky 1977 that languages without an inclusive/exclusive contrast (almost) invariably treat the inclusive meaning as a first person rather than second. We focus on Harbour 2016 who proposes a system that describes all and only the attested categories without appeal to additional postulates such as a person hierarchy, but introduces several novel assumptions about the semantics of features. We suggest that the key innovation in Harbour's proposal is the use of cumulative (non-Boolean) conjunction in word-internal composition. We offer a more conservative alternative, showing that the main result can be derived with cumulative conjunction and exhaustification, while avoiding the other novel assumptions in Harbour's approach. Moreover, we contend that our approach is empirically superior regarding certain apparently mixed clusivity systems, notably Mandarin pronouns. More broadly, the result argues that cumulative conjunction and exhaustification are available in word-internal semantics just like in sentence semantics.",1
"Passivization in Turkish may target both internal and external argument positions, for passives of unaccusatives, unergatives and transitives are possible in the language. Interestingly, Turkish also has double passives where the passive morpheme is iterated, and both argument positions are saturated. However, the language does not allow for antipassives, where only the internal argument position of a transitive predicate is saturated by passivization. Importantly, under plausible compositional analyses, antipassives are fully predicted, contrary to the fact. Hence, the unavailability of antipassives in a language that has double passives (and passives of unaccusatives) remains as a puzzle, which this paper sets out to solve. In particular, we argue that antipassives are ruled out on the grounds that the passive morpheme is visible to the case calculus in terms of Dependent Case Theory but has to remain caseless throughout the
derivation. We show that this account also correctly predicts that internal argument positions that happen to be lexical case positions can never be targeted by passivization. Finally, we provide a fine-grained analysis of internal argument suppression accounting for the aspectual restrictions it has been reported to have, and compare our work to the existing proposals.",0
"It is claimed in Key 2013 that Turkish, despite allowing multiple causative morphemes on a single complex verb, does not in fact allow causative recursion, where one causing event is embedded by another causing event. This paper argues against Key's conclusion, using evidence from eventhood diagnostics to show that ""double"" causatives in Turkish encode two distinct, syntactically represented causing events in addition to the caused event. Thus Turkish causatives are indeed recursive. This finding supports approaches to productive affixal causatives which allow recursive embedding of the same category over approaches which rely on a fixed functional hierarchy.",0
"Expressive and ideophonic constructions conveying 'marked words that depict sensory imagery' (Dingemanse 2012) are frequently found in the languages of all regions of the world, but their distribution, use and functioning across languages of the Caucasus has never been documented from a regional perspective. This chapter will survey the various kinds of expressive language present in the three autochthonous Caucasian families Abkhaz-Adyghean, Kartvelian and Nakh-Daghestanian, and find they vary in terms of:

1) their morphological exponence,
2) the extent to which their overall typological profile constrains how expressive forms may be formed,
3) grammatical categories exclusive to expressives,
4) expressives as a source for lexical innovation,
5) expressives as a locus of diachronic change

It will also look in-depth at the specific morphological and syntactic peculiarities of expressives in Georgian, which exhibit exuberant consonant clusters, processes of reduplication uncharacteristic of the language as a whole, as well as specific morphosyntactic alignment splits between different classes of expressive. Expressives will be seen not to be one thing, but many.",0
"Cross-linguistically, morphomes are empirically robust but there are few well-studied cases outside of Romance.  We analyze the distribution of present and aorist stems in Western Armenian, an understudied Indo-European language. Canonically, the aorist encodes perfective aspect, but it is meaninglessly used in different paradigm cells for different conjugation classes. For these meaningless cases, the aorist stem acts as a morphomic item.  The shape of the aorist stem varies across conjugation classes, including regular classes that use a dedicated aorist suffix vs. irregular classes that use root suppletion. This parallelism across the regular and irregular verbs further establishes that the aorist stem is a legitimate morphological item, and not just a set of homophonous items. We formalize  the data in Distributed Morphology, a post-syntactic morphological framework. We use head-insertion or node-sprouting to model how  the aorist suffix has canonical perfective semantics, but it is meaninglessly inserted by the morphology in non-perfective contexts.  We find that the creation of the aorist stem occurs   early in the derivation, and it cyclically interacts with allomorphy and morphophonological alternations.  In sum, the morphomic aorist is well-integrated into Armenian morphotactics, and morphomic elements  interact with other morphological operations. *** Printed title is Derivational timing of morphomes: Canonicity and rule ordering in the Armenian aorist stem",1
"A recent quantitative study claims language structure to be unaffected by the proportion of those speaking the language non-natively [A. Koplenig, Royal Society Open Science, 6, 181274 (2019)]. This result hinges on the imputation of an assumed zero proportion of L2 (second-language) speakers for languages which are considered non-vehicular but for which no direct estimate of that proportion exists. We provide an alternative analysis and interpretation of the same data, treating uncertain non-vehicular languages as missing data points. In a multiple regression, controlling for population size, we find that higher proportions of L2 speakers predict lower morphological as well as information-theoretic complexity.",0
"A growing body of research shows that readers/listeners are biased by the grammatical gender of a noun when making inferences about the gender of its referent. This result is central in debates about gender-fair language but
has mostly been established using masculine generics. This paper presents two preregistered studies on French that aim to replicate this result but using a lesser-studied type of nouns: generic hybrid nouns. These nouns can refer
to both male and female individuals but are either masculine or feminine, depending on the noun (e.g. un talent 'a talent' and une vedette 'a star'). The availability of both genders for hybrid nouns allows for a more comprehensive
test of the effect of grammatical gender than permitted by masculine generics. Overall, the paper replicates the role of grammatical biases in gender inferences, with masculine hybrid nouns being judged as more likely to refer to male individuals as compared to feminine hybrid nouns. However the results did not reveal a symmetric bias for feminine nouns, which were interpreted as gender-neutral. But this latter result should be interpreted with caution as it could be due to uncontrolled effects of gender stereotypes coming from the specific stimuli used in the study.",0

"This paper argues that tone-driven epenthesis is possible in tonal languages, contrary to claims in the literature that it is unattested/impossible. In Wamey, an epenthetic [ə] is inserted to host a high tone in two contexts. The first is to host a tone which would otherwise be left floating due to a restriction on rising tones in closed syllables, i.e. /cv̀cⒽ/ maps to [cv̀cə́] due to a ban *[cv̌c]. The second is to host a tone which is introduced by word-level morphology but is restricted from associating across a stem boundary, i.e. an input /(cv̀cv̀)cⒽ/ maps to [(cv̀cv̀)cə́] not *[(cv̀cv́)c]. These patterns cannot be attributed to syllable phonotactics, which freely allow all consonants in coda position. We assemble the evidence for tone-driven epenthesis, focusing on the distribution of final [ə] in lexical stem structure and [ə]-alternating suffixes which pattern as underlyingly consonant-final. A simple OT analysis derives [ə]-epenthesis, utilising common constraints (e.g. *FLOAT, *RISE, OCP(H), DEP(μ), etc.) together with constraints against associating tone across certain prosodic boundaries. In total, Wamey provides evidence for parallelism between tonal and intonational languages given that intonation-driven epenthesis is well-established in the literature. This parallelism is predicted under a model where both types of prosodic systems make use of the same phonological substance and autosegmental architecture, and have the same functional pressures to cultivate segmental environments best suited for realizing pitch targets.",1
"Over the last 30 years, a strand of literature has debated the existence of abstract Case and its licensing function. While some recent work has argued in favor of abstract Case in languages that show no morphological case (Sheehan and van der Wal 2016, Halpert 2016), languages with this profile are overwhelmingly nominatively-aligned; there are no documented examples of an abstract ergative alignment with no morphological ergativity. Furthermore, most cross-linguistic work on ergativity assumes that all syntactically ergative languages also show morphological ergative case (Dixon 1994). This generalization is somewhat surprising from a case-theoretic perspective: if abstract Case exists, we expect to find a language with syntactic ergativity and no morphological ergativity. 

In this paper, I demonstrate that such a language is in fact attested: Nukuoro (Polynesian Outlier) shows a restriction on ergative extraction despite a lack of morphological ergative case. Additionally, I show that abstract Case in Nukuoro is required for nominal licensing, a claim supported by two environments where licensing appears to fail: namely, within VP and in non-finite clauses. In this way, Nukuoro provides further support for abstract Case in languages without morphological case (Sheehan and van der Wal 2016), specifically abstract ergative Case, as well as a nominal licensing requirement for DP arguments (i.e., the Case Filter; Chomsky 1981).",0
"Current NLP research uses neither linguistically annotated corpora nor the traditional pipeline of linguistic modules, which raises questions about the future of linguistics. Linguists who have tried to crack the secrets of deep learning NLP models, including BERT (a bidirectional transformer-based ML technique employed for Google Search), have had as their ultimate goal to show that deep nets make linguistic generalizations. I decided for an alternative approach. To check whether it is possible to process natural language without grammar, I developed a very simple model, the End-to-end N-Gram Model (EteNGraM), that elaborates on the standard n-gram model.  EteNGraM, at a very basic level, imitates current NLP research by handling semantic relations without semantics. Like in NLP, I pre-trained the model with the orders of the TAM markers in the verbal domain, fine-tuned it, and then applied it for derivation of Greenberg's Universal 20 and its exceptions in the nominal domain. Although EteNGraM is ridiculously simple and operates only with bigrams and trigrams, it successfully derives and differentiates between the attested and unattested patterns in Cinque (2005) ""Deriving Greenberg's Universal 20 and Its Exceptions"", Linguistic Inquiry 36, and Cinque (2014) ""Again on Tense, Aspect, Mood Morpheme Order and the ""Mirror Principle""."" In Functional Structure from Top to Toe: The Cartography of Syntactic Structures 9. EteNGraM also makes fine-grained predictions about preferred and dispreferred patterns across languages and reveals novel aspects of the organization of the verbal and nominal domain. To explain EteNGraM's highly efficient performance, I address issues such as: complexity of data versus complexity of analysis; structure building by linear sequences of elements and by hierarchical syntactic trees; and how linguists can contribute to NLP research.*

"The logical problem of language acquisition has been at the forefront of psycholinguistics and behavioral neuroscience for decades. One of the most influential answers to the problem of how successful acquisition occurs on the basis of noisy input suggests that the child is aided by innate principles and parameters (P&P). These are conceived aspart of our biological endowment for language. Previous work on the computability of parametric models has focused on the process of parameter-setting,leaving settability unaddressed. Settability is a key notion in parametric models since it provides an answer to the logical problem of language acquisition: the setting of one parameter carries implications for the settability of others, minimizing the child's task. However, a mathematical analysis of the expected probability of successful computation of settability relations has not been carried out. We report results from a novel program developed to calculate the probability of successful computation of a network of 62 linguistic parameters as attested in 28 languages, spanning across 5 language families. The results reveal that some parameters have an extremely low probability of successful computation, such that trillions of unsuccessful computations are expected before a successful setting occurs. Using the same program, we performed an additional second analysis to a different network, covering 94 parameters from58 languages and 15 language families. In this case, the estimated number of expected unsuccessful computations rose from trillions to quadrillions. These results raise concerns about the computational feasibility of the highly influential P&P approach to language development. Merging insights from various acquisition models, including some developed within P&P, a biologically plausible alternative is offered for the process of deciphering a target grammar in the acquisition of both spoken and signed languages. Overall, our analysis of the P&P approach to language acquisition centers learnability and computability constraints as the major factors for determining the psychological plausibility of grammar development.",0
"In Washo (isolate/Hokan, USA), verbs always mark the person feature of the subject, but object marking is more complex. While overt objects are never marked, covert objects are obligatorily marked where possible, which is only with certain subject-object combinations. The generalization we find is that participant (first/second person) objects are marked regardless of the person of the subject, while third person object marking is only allowed if the subject is also third person. We claim that the Washo pattern illustrates a reverse, weak Person-Case Constraint (PCC) effect (*PART>3). To account for this effect, we adopt Deal's (2015, 2021) Interaction and Satisfaction framework with dynamic interaction, in which a single probe agrees with the subject and the object from a higher position, giving rise to the reverse flavor. We also argue that verbal indexing of covert objects in Washo is pronoun incorporation, which is licensed only by interaction with the probe. Zooming out, we show that the Washo data are a counterexample to Stegovec's (2019, 2020) generalization that reverse PCC effects only occur alongside canonical (i.e. non-reverse) PCC effects, as Washo specifically bans PART>3, but not 3>PART. In addition, we draw a comparison with Aleut. This language differs from Washo in that, in certain configurations, the object is higher than the subject (Yuan 2018), and as predicted by our high probe account, the PCC effects are canonical rather than reverse",1
"Usarufa is a dialect of the Awiyaana language, spoken in the eastern high-lands of Papua New Guinea. The present paper is the only discussion of Awiyaana appearing since the grammar of Bee (1973). It is shown that Bee's work, written within the ""tagmemic"" tradition, is an inadequate account of the language, and that this inadequacy is a direct result of the subordination of scientific principles to an ideological agenda. It is also shown that this prioritizing of ideology at the expense of science is not confined to Bee, nor to Usarufa, nor to linguistics.",0
"Agreement is a grammatical phenomenon whereby the form of a morpheme or word co-varies with the morphosyntactic properties of another word or phrase, typically a noun. Although agreement is, by definition, conditioned by the φ-features (e.g. person umber/gender features) of a noun, a broader survey of cross-linguistic patterns reveals that the surface realisation of a noun may similarly have an effect on agreement, even when its φ-features are kept constant. Focusing on noun-verb agreement dependencies, we provide several case studies illustrating this idea, and show that relevant factors range from a noun's morphological case to its structural position. Although in many cases these effects may be analysed in purely syntactic terms-that is, derivable from conditions on the syntactic process underlying agreement-we also highlight cross-linguistic patterns that seem to involve non-structural factors.",0
"Applications of the *ABA generalization (Bobaljik 2012) have been fruitfully proposed in many domains. In this short squib, we propose that a similar generalization obtains in the domain of numerals, with the triplet being the cardinal, the ordinal and the fractional, and hypothesize that these categories stand in a morphosyntactic containment relation. There are ABB patterns (e.g. three, the third, two thirds), AAB patterns (e.g. four, the fourth, three quarters), ABC patterns (two, the second, one half), but no robust *ABA patterns of this type. We have so far surveyed the cardinal, ordinal and fractional expressions for 1 through 5 in 38 languages from 17 language families and look forward to any potential supporting or counterexamples!",0
"This paper deals with the so-called 'inflectionless adjectives' in Bulgarian. Several new empirical observations are made regarding the syntactic distribution, the restrictions on definiteness and the exclamatory flavour of the noun phrases in which these adjectives occur. The main proposal is that these lexical items are predicates of (nominal) small clauses and that the construction in question does not seem to be limited to these exceptional adjectives. It is argued that both the attributive type and the comparative type of nominal predication are attested in Bulgarian, on a par with English small clauses like 'an idiot doctor' and 'an idiot of a man'. I outline a syntactic account of these two types of nominal predication, according to which the two types correspond to different structures. I also propose that the semantic and syntactic properties of inflectionless adjectives are best accounted for if we assume that they combine with a null noun.",0
"This work investigates the syntactic and semantic distribution of reflexive forms themself vs. themselves. We focus on whether the use of -self vs -selves is affected by specificity of the antecedent, distinguishing seven levels for a singular antecedent: quantified indefinites (some/any), quantified universals (each/every o), generic kind definites, specific indefinites, specific definites, unknown specific person, named person. We administered an online acceptability judgment survey to 1,127 participants, recruited on Twitter and Prolific, who rated sentences on a 5-point Likert scale from ""very natural"" to ""very unnatural,"" in a randomized order, and then completed a short demographic survey. We find that antecedent type, -self/-selves form of the anaphor, and social variables including age, gender, and endorsement of prescriptive language ideology all affected how participants rated the sentences; themself was generally rated higher than themselves for most antecedents, contra previous findings. Our results seem to indicate that themself is preferred by many English speakers for singular antecedents, and also that the singular use of themself/themselves is a sociosyntactically active and salient variable across those speakers.",0
"Language is subject to a variety of pressures. Recent work has documented that many aspects of language structure have properties that appear to be shaped by biases for the efficient communication of semantic meaning. Other work has investigated the role of social pressures, whereby linguistic variants can acquire positive or negative evaluation based on who is perceived to be using them. While the influence of these two sets of biases on language change has been well-documented, they have typically been treated separately, in distinct lines of research. We used a miniature-language paradigm to test how these biases interact in language change. Specifically, we asked whether pressures to mark social meaning can lead linguistic systems to become less efficient at communicating semantic meaning. We exposed participants to a miniature language with uninformative constituent order and two dialects, one of which employed case and the other one did not. In the instructions, we socially biased participants toward users of the case dialect, users of the no-case dialect, or toward neither. Learners biased toward the no-case dialect dropped informative case, thus creating a linguistic system with high message uncertainty. They failed to compensate for this increased message uncertainty even after additional exposure to the novel language. Case was retained in all other conditions. These findings suggest that not only do social biases interact with biases for efficient communication in language change, but that they can lead to linguistic systems that are less efficient at communicating semantic meaning.",0
"Some English verbs use distinct forms for the preterite (e.g. I BROKE the door) and the past participle (e.g. I've BROKEN the door). These verbs may variably show use of the preterite form in place of the participle (e.g. I've BROKE the door), which we call PARTICIPLE LEVELING. This paper contributes the ﬁrst detailed variationist study of participle leveling by investigating the phenomenon in perfect constructions using data collected from three corpora of conversational speech: two of American English and one of British English. A striking degree of similarity is found between the three corpora in both the linguistic and the extralinguistic constraints on variation. Constraints on participle leveling include tense of the perfect construction, verb frequency, and phonological similarity between preterite and participle forms. The variable is stable in real time and socially stratiﬁed. The paper relates the ﬁndings to theoretical linguistic treatments of the variation, and to questions of its origin and spread in Englishes transatlantically.",0

Up to the present, it has been allophonic only. This change is an immediate upshot of politically correct gendering.

"A'-extraction of possessors in West Circassian is constrained in a puzzling way: the possessor of an ergative or applied argument DP may not undergo clausebound wh-movement, but long-distance possessor extraction across a clausal boundary is grammatical. Based on the variable islandhood of these DPs, this talk argues for an agree-based approach to phasehood. Phase opacity is treated as defective intervention, with the phase intervening between the probe and the goal. Defective intervention does not take place if the corresponding phase has independently entered an Agree relation with the movement-triggering probe. Islandhood is thus correctly predicted to be contextually determined: in West Circassian, the difference between clausebound and long-distance possessor extraction is conditioned by the set of agreement features on the local movement-triggering probe: a wh-feature on C in the case of clausebound extraction and a successive-cyclic edge feature on embedded C in the case of long-distance wh-movement. Additionally, the account appeals to the opacity of phase edges to explain the contrast between DPs which display islandhood effects (ergative and applied argument DPs) and constituents which are uniformly transparent for subextraction (the absolutive DP and postpositional phrases).",0
"Distinctions related to person and animacy have long been known to impact both the grammar and incremental processing in a way that can be described through ""prominence"" scales. We put the generalizability of these scales to the test by examining the processing effects of a typologically uncommon distinction known as obviation, which is found in Ojibwe, an Indigenous language of North America. Obviation contrasts the single most discourse-salient animate third person
(proximate) with other non-salient third persons (obviative). Using a visual world paradigm, we show that obviation influences parsing and interpretation commitments under incremental ambiguity: Proximate nouns are assumed to be the agent of an action, while obviative nouns do not lead to strong incremental commitments. This result parallels previous findings in other languages with distinctions related to animacy and person, supporting a theory where the effect of prominence information in processing is the result of a common set of constraints derived from the alignment of scales related to person, syntactic position, and thematic role.",0
"In this article I argue that Dutch has referential compounds: compounds with a referential non-head, even though that claim seems to be a contradictio in terminis. They resemble the Dutch s-possessive in that their non-heads involve movement to a referential layer. However, unlike the possessive structures, the compounding structure contains head incorporation which results in word-hood. The referential compound is therefore an instance of the fourth logical possibility according to the two parameters defined by Borer (2011) for N-N combinations: compounding versus constructs and modificational structures versus referential ones. The article further discusses title expressions, such as prince Charles, which are argued to be referential construct states. Together with the syntactic structure of titles plus proper names, the referential compounds further contribute evidence to the idea that a ban on N-to-D movement for certain uniquely referring roots, such as sun and Bronx is extra-syntactic.",0
"Since the development of a fine-grained syntax of the DP and the IP projections in the late 1980's, some similarities and correspondences have been further noted across the two types of projections. Varies attempts have been made to explain these similarities.

One of the most serious attempts to explain the correspondences across the nominal and the verbal domains is Wiltschko's 2014 Universal Spine Hypothesis (USP). According to USP, the verbal and nominal extended projections are unified at an abstract syntactic level. They emerge from a single abstract projection that gets instantiated by different categorial units of individual languages.

In this paper, I will present a supporting evidence to Wiltschko's hypothesis by arguing that the prospective aspect of the verbal spine and the dative case feature of the nominal spine are unified at abstract level. The evidence is mainly from the Amharic language. But, I will also suggest that the same analysis can be extended to the English infinitive marker to which also happen to be a dative marker.",0
"All possessive structures in Äiwoo contain clausal structure, revolving around the abstract verb POSS, a transitive Undergoer Voice (UV) verb. This verb can be used by itself to form clausal possession: ""I POSS the boat"" ≈ ""the boat is mine"". Importantly, possessed DPs also contain the verb POSS: the object of this verb is extracted, to form a relative clause. Informally described, ""my boat"" really is ""the boat [that I POSS __]"" ≈ ""the boat that is mine"". Thus, Äiwoo doesn't have true nominal possessives like my, mine, their(s), or anything like the Saxon genitive 's; the only way to form a possessed DP in Äiwoo is through relativization. Evidence for this comes from word order syntax, voice morphology, and agreement morphology.

This has implications for our understanding of the syntactic properties
of possession cross-linguistically. An influential view (Szabolcsi 1983, 1994, Freeze 1992, Kayne 1993) maintains that universally, all clausal possession is derived from an underlying nominal (DP-like) constituent, from where an argument is extracted. Äiwoo does it the other way around (deriving possessed DPs from clauses), and thus it challenges the universality of this approach.

"Cross-linguistically, it is difficult to tease apart allomorphy from readjustment rules. But regardless, both tend to respect locality and are sensitive to information that is present in the input, not the output (Embick 2010, 2013, 2017). We document a counter-example to these tendencies from Western Armenian, and we discuss how the data falsifies such restrictive models of allomorphy. The Western Armenian theme vowel -i- changes to the theme vowel -e- due to two types of triggers. The first type of trigger is phonological: the change happens when the theme vowel is unstressed in the output. This is a type of allomorphy that is conditioned by output phonology (contra Paster 2006). The second type of trigger is morphological: the change happens when the verb is in the past tense. The +Past morpheme can be either in the verb (adja- cent to the theme vowel) or on a separate auxiliary in periphrasis. This amounts to a case of long-distance allomorphy that is conditioned across words, even in suspended affixation (contra Bobaljik 2012). For suspended affixation, I provide semantic and prosodic evidence that suspended affixation is created via base-generation and not via ellipsis. The inability to use ellipsis acts as additional evidence that the allomorphy is long-distance. ******[Title: Output-conditioned and non-local allomorphy in Armenian theme vowels]",1
"The functional-typological literature distinguishes two kinds of inverse constructions: inverse voice, in which the patient becomes the subject, and inverse alignment, in which the patient is agreed with like a canonical subject. In this literature, Algonquian languages are held to be the prototypical example of a system in which the two kinds of inverses coexist: the inverse is a ""deep"" voice construction in clauses with two third-person arguments and a ""shallow"" alignment pattern in clauses in which a third person acts on an SAP. This paper argues that this conclusion is correct and attempts to reconcile it with formal models of voice and agreement. It is proposed that despite their distinct syntactic underpinnings, both inverse constructions result in a derivation in which Voice lacks phi-features and Infl indexes only the patient. This shared outcome explains why the inverse appears to be a unified phenomenon from a morphological perspective even though its syntactic correlates differ in third-person and SAP contexts.",1
"In Government Phonology and its descendants, there is a direct relation between representational complexity and lateral strength, as only melodically filled nuclei can discharge government and licensing. This relation is only broken in special circumstances, e.g. when lateral actorship is granted by a systemic parameter. In this paper, I provide a normalisation of lateral actorship by showing that the latter's correlation with complexity also holds for some silent nuclei without introducing a dedicated parameter. The hypothesis is that representational complexity does not necessarily correspond to some phonetic event: a non-empty nucleus can be unpronounced, without this impinging on its lateral actorship. Turbidity Theory provides the formal tools for distinguishing between empty and unpronounced nuclei. This follows from splitting the association between melodic and prosodic units into two independent relations - projection and pronunciation. Empty nuclei lack melodic content, whereas unpronounced nuclei only lack the pronunciation relation. This approach is shown to account for disparate phenomena, such as glide mutation in Classic Arabic, inflectional markers spell-out in Egyptian Colloquial Arabic and the apparently exceptional behaviour of muta cum liquida clusters in Hungarian and in the Italian dialect of Finale Emilia. This approach also allows for a refinement of our understanding of the so-called yers, as well as for constraining the use of floating melody.",0
"There are three ways of deriving verbs in Dutch: through zero marking, through suffixation, and through prefixation. We focus on prefixed deadjectival verbs, contrasting two views. According to the first view, prefixed verbs are left-headed: the prefix is responsible for the change in category, i.e. [V ver [A breed]]. The second view holds that prefixed verbs are right-headed, and involve a zero verbalizing suffix, i.e., [V ver [V [A breed] ∅ ]]. We argue in this paper for a mixed approach. We adopt Ramchand's (2008) decomposition of the verb and argue that the prefix spells out part of the verbal structure and the verbal root spells out another part.",0

"Georgian features three patterns of nominal inflection, which are dependent on the structure of the stem. The stem can be consonantal, vocalic truncating, and vocalic non-truncating, with the consequences for the shape of the inflectional suffixes. However, variants of each individual case suffix differ across the three stem types in unique ways, with no single pattern being used for more than one grammatical case. This could suggest a solution based on traditional allomorph selection from a predefined list of stored forms. The paper argues, however, that a phonological explanation of the pattern is possible when rich autosegmental representations are employed. The analysis is couched within the CVCV model of phonology (Scheer 2004).",0
"It is often claimed by Chinese generative researchers (Cheng and Huang 1994, Li 1999, Huang 2006) that Mandarin resultatives do not respect the Direct Object Restriction (DOR).

"Infixation and allomorphy have long been investigated as independent phenomena---see, e.g., Ultan 1975, Moravcsik 1977, Yu 2007 on infixation, and Carstairs 1987, Paster 2006, Veselinova 2006, Bobaljik 2012 on allomorphy. But, relatively little is known about what happens when infixation and allomorphy coincide. This paper presents the results of the first cross-linguistic study of allomorphy involving infixation, considering 51 case studies from 42 languages (15 language families). Allomorphy and infixation interact systematically, with distinct sets of behaviors characterizing suppletive and non-suppletive allomorphy involving an infix. Perhaps most notably, suppletive allomorphy is conditioned only at/from the stem edge, while non-suppletive allomorphy is conditioned only in the surface (infixed) environment. The robustness of these and related findings supports a universal serial architecture of the morphosyntax-phonology interface where: (i) infixation is indirect, involving displacement from a stem-edge position to a stem-internal one, counter to several influential theories of infixation (see especially McCarthy and Prince 1993a and Yu 2007); (ii) suppletive exponent choice is prior to (i.e., not regulated by) the phonological grammar (in line with Paster 2006, Pak 2016, Kalin 2020, Rolle 2021, Stanton To Appear, i.a.); and (iii) realization---including exponent choice and infixation---proceeds from the bottom of the morphosyntactic structure upward (à la Bobaljik 2000, Embick 2010, Myler 2017).",0
"Diachronic studies of the English -self anaphor observe that its source is an early self-intensifier (as in the queen herself came), compounded with a pronoun to reduce ambiguity in the third person. This paper suggests that this change is part of a cycle, where the pronoun-self compounding is a stage of renewal. The proposal is based on (i) etymological studies of Indo-European languages, showing that intensifiers like Germanic self and Latin ipse reveal traces of earlier cycles of compounding with a pronominal element; (ii) typological surveys relating complex reflexives, simple reflexives and middle morphology in a cyclic process; and (iii) historical research from Semitic languages, showing that the meaning of body-part expressions has evolved from the lexical source to reflexive meaning to intensifier. Reduction is shown to proceed in two paths corresponding to the distinct prosodic patterns exhibited by reflexives and intensifiers, resulting in verbal morphemes or zero anaphora in the former case, and heavier focus particles in the latter. The analysis places reflexivity on a par with other cyclic processes in language change, and explains the cross-linguistic variation in reflexive strategies, where different forms such as Arabic nafs-x, English x-self, French se-, zero anaphora, German selbst etc. correspond to different stages in the cycle.",0
"[Paper in its published version]. Left-hand adjuncts of left-headed (= head-initial) phrases are constrained in a particular way that is unheard of for head-final phrases. The head of the adjunct must be phrase-final. Anything that follows the head disqualifies the phrase as an adjunct. The effect of this head-final-constraint is adjacency between the head of the adjunct and the phrase the adjunct is adjoined to. Adjuncts to head-final phrases are not constrained that way. This holds for adverbials, viz. adjuncts to VPs and APs, as well as for adnominal attributes.

This constraint does not follow from any known conditions on phrase structuring. It will be shown to arise from a licensing requirement that holds for phrases to be merged with a given phrase. Left adjuncts of head-initial phrases are not in the licensing domain of the head of the phrase and therefore they are in need of an alternative way of getting licensed. This alternative way – proper attachment – results in the hitherto unaccounted adjacency effect.",0
"The paper tries to give a formal answer to the following question: how did the Indo-European hypothesis become the most successful one in the comparative linguistics. I interpret this ""empirical reliability"" of the Indo-European as the availability of a high number of roots shared by all the involved languages (or, at least, by the most representative ones). An attempt is made to correlate the empirical reliability to the inflectionality of these languages. It is argued that, unlike morphological compositionality in agglutinative languages, the idiomaticity of derivation observed in the inflectional languages allows them to preserve more lexemes suitable for filling the cognate table. The hypothesis is tested by comparing two random groups of languages: Germanic for the inflectional type and Finno-Ugric for the agglutinative. The evidence seems to confirm the claim.",0
"A lively research field has recently emerged that uses experimental methods to probe the linguistic behavior of modern deep networks. While work in this tradition often reports intriguing results about the grammatical skills of deep nets, it is not clear what their implications for linguistic theorizing should be. As a consequence, linguistically-oriented deep net analysis has had very little impact on linguistics at large. In this chapter, I suggest that deep networks should be treated as theories making explicit predictions about the acceptability of linguistic utterances. I argue that, if we overcome some obstacles standing in the way of seriously pursuing this idea, we will gain a powerful new theoretical tool, complementary to mainstream algebraic approaches.",1
"The notion of constructions plays a prominent role in recent HPSG analyses of
various phenomena (see, e.g., Boas and Sag 2012; Sag et al. 2020; Kim and Michaelis 2020). For
example, a detailed analysis of the English auxiliary system by Sag et al. (2020) extensively exploits
the hierarchical network of constructional templates in Sign-Based Construction Grammar (SBCxG)
in accounting for some of the familiar and recalcitrant facts in the syntax of auxiliary verbs in English.
In particular, one of the claims made by Sag et al. (2020) is that the idiosyncratic patterns exhibited
by some of the specific lexical items (such as the auxiliary use of better and first person singular
inverted aren't) pose significant challenges to transformational approaches (such as Pollock 1989) that
attempt to derive the core properties of the auxiliary system from abstract general principles.
Categorial grammar (CG) offers an interesting perspective in this theory comparison. While shar-
ing with traditional HPSG the spirit of strong lexicalism, the type-logical variant of CG recognizes
abstract operations in syntax similar to transformational operations which seem somewhat alien to the
surface-oriented perspective embodied in much HPSG research (see Kubota 2021). In fact, in a recent
paper, Kubota and Levine (2022) make extensive use of transformation-like operations in account-
ing for the NI(C)E properties and the do support pattern in Hybrid Type-Logical Grammar (Hybrid
TLG; Kubota and Levine 2020). One major omission in Kubota and Levine's (2022) proposal is the
idiosyncratic patterns that Sag et al. (2020) take to be problematic for transformational approaches.
Since there is currently no direct analogue of the notion of constructions in CG (but see Steedman and
Baldridge (2011) for an interesting suggestion for lexicalizing some of the constructional templates in
Goldberg (1995)), such facts may initially seem equally challenging for CG-based approaches. The
goal of the present paper is to take up this challenge, and work out some of the beginnings of an
account of 'constructional patterns' within a CG-based architecture of grammar.",0
"The specific goal of the article is to investigate the principles governing the perception of rhythmic structure in dance and music – taken separately and together – on the basis of a case study. I take as a starting point Lerdahl and Jackendoff's (1983) conception of musical rhythm as the interaction between grouping and meter, and I examine to what extent it can apply to dance. Then, I explore how the rhythmical structures of music and dance interact in a single event. I conclude that dance and music perception largely share the same abstract system, and the differences in the properties of their structure derives from the different (visual vs. auditory) modalities in which they are perceived; their modality difference also affects the perceived structure resulting from their combination in dance-music events.
The exploration is guided by a detailed examination of the opening of Stravinsky's Augurs of Spring (1913) as choreographed by Nijinsky (1913), Béjart (1970) and Bausch (1975). By comparing these minimal pairs of dance-music events, I adapt the formal methodology of linguistics to other cognitive systems. The general goal of the article is to shed further light on the organizational principles of mental representations by comparing several cognitive systems in order to distinguish between general cognitive properties and modality-specific or domain-specific properties.",0
"This paper focuses on several morphosyntactic properties connected to qualitative binominal constructions (QBCs, complex noun phrases of the type a jewelNP1 of a villageNP2) from a Southern Italo-Romance language spoken in the Apulian town of San Marco in Lamis (Foggia). Here, QBCs appear in two ways: prepositionally (with də, allowing definites, indefinites, and demonstratives), and non-prepositionally, (only allowing definite nouns with definite articles, and hence not proper names). We will suggest that in the latter type N1 and N2 are related by a categorial match in their determiner layer, 'match D'. N1, a property-denoting element, is embedded as a noun, which allows 1) the recursive DP strategy found in non-prepositional genitives; 2) the generalization of this mechanism to qualitative phrases, where N1 has an adjective-like function. This derives the impossibility of syntactic operations such as extraction (which we connect to the notion of phase). With non-denominal N1s, N1's article will be treated as head-agreeing adjectival linkers, which form a constituent with the modifier but agree with the head. We will suggest that a phrase is interpreted as a qualitative binominal if N1 and N2 share the same number features and if the features of N1 do not allow for it to be interpreted as the head/possessum of N2. A few words will be spent on external agreement with either noun of the construction, and we will see that the data confirm the relevance of [+HUMAN] features with regard to agreement relations.

"In this paper, I argue that agreement and case are assigned in different ways across various causee and other internal arguments. I show that agreement is a relativized system where the presence of one argument DP x higher than the other DP y would inhibit the relation of the latter with the verb. Case, on the other hand, is argued to be insensitive to the presence of intervening arguments DP. Case is a fixed relationship between the case assigning head and the DP in its specifier. I explained this distinctions by assuming different orders of syntactic operations. Case is assigned early in the syntactic derivation–probably just after Merge. But, Agree relations are established pretty late in the derivation. As such other syntactic derivation such as Movement (topicalization) affect the nature of Agree relations between two syntactic objects.",0
"On the basis of synchronic and diachronic data we argue that in the human domain German masculine nouns commonly display a ""non-male"" generic interpretation which we take as evidence for a separation of syntactic and semantic gender: Syn-chronically, we show that agreement differences between masculine and feminine nouns cannot be traced back to their semantic gender since nouns without sex speci-fication (as e.g. feminine 'Person' (person) or masculine 'Mensch' (human being)) be-have just as differently as nouns with sex specification. In the diachronic part, we prove that the so-called generic masculine is a stable and well documented phenom-enon in the grammatical system of German at least since the OHG period. To substan-tiate this claim, we present numerous historical examples for the generic use of masculine nouns such as 'Gast' (guest), 'Nachbar' (neighbour), 'Sünder' (sinner). These nouns allow us to look at the particular language use without confounding it with the sociological problem of women's lack of professional integration in the past.",0
"This chapter has two goals. First, I summarize the development of theories of nominal inflection with Distributed Morphology (DM) and DM-friendly approaches. This part is a literature review and draws on evidence from a variety of languages. Second, I aim to further concretize aspects of the DM model of inflection by exploring how the appearance of inflection has been and can be modeled in the theory. In this part, I focus on the inflection of attributive adjectives in Ingush (ISO inh), a Nakh-Daghestanian language, using data from Nichols's (2011) descriptive grammar. I argue that at least some forms of inflection cannot be reduced to purely morphological (i.e., syntax-free) well-formedness.",0
"The Classical Latin verb has featured prominently in the literature on theoretical morphology. In particular, the notoriously unpredictable forms of the past participles that nevertheless show reliable syncretism with a semantically diverse set of deverbals challenge our notions about the relationship between form and meaning. The various treatments of this system disagree not only in their theoretical building blocks but also in their basic assumptions about what ought to be explained, which makes it difficult to properly evaluate them against one another. This paper aims to empirically motivate the prior assumptions about productivity and arbitrariness that drive these accounts. In applying insights developed for child language acquisition to a large Latin corpus, the variables of productivity are held constant and theoretical frameworks are compared on equal footing. It becomes clear that the productive past participle forms do not line up well with the frequency-based assumptions of prior accounts and instead mirror the diachronic developments that the system underwent on its path to Romance. A new treatment is proposed to incorporate the acquisition results and to conform with diachronic outcomes. The methods developed here reveal explanatory gaps in the theories that had not previously been appreciated and emphasize the importance of quantitative evidence from a range of sources in future morphological analysis.",1
"We present a case study of grammatical tone allomorphy in Cilungu (Bantu). Tense/Aspect/Mood designations (TAMs) are realized via co-exponence of prefixes, suffixes, and floating tones. In a minority of TAMs, there is allomorphy with the floating tones. For example, in the Recent Past one allomorph involves floating tone targeting the final mora of the stem (ⒽF) versus one targeting the stem's second mora (Ⓗ2). For all such allomorphic TAMs, the alternation is conditioned by the tone of subject agreement markers (SMs) at the left edge of the word. If the SM is high-toned the ⒽF variant occurs, but if it is toneless then Ⓗ2 occurs. We present two competing accounts of these data. Under a morphological account, we posit contextual realizational rules with multiple suppletive exponents conditioned by SM tone. In contrast, under a phonological account a 'first-last tone harmony' applies here, morphologically restricted to the context of SMs with a small set of TAMs. Such a harmony rule captures a generalization of these alternations: if the SM is high at the left edge then there is a grammatical high at the right edge, but if the left edge is toneless then grammatical tone does not fall on the right edge. We present several arguments in favor of the morphological analysis (suppletion) over a phonological one (harmony). Specifically, the patterns are not subject to phonological locality, other TAMs involving similar tone patterns are not subject to this harmony, and the proposed first-last tone harmony would be a highly phonologically-unnatural rule with little cross-linguistic support, and exceeding the computational properties of all well-known and established phonological operations. We conclude by discussing a major theoretical implication of the morphological account: this constitutes outward-sensitive phonologically-conditioned suppletive allomorphy, standardly argued to be unattested and/or impossible. Ultimately, we hold that under either account Cilungu presents a novel and important contribution to linguistic theory.",0

"Impoverishment is a feature deletion operation that is standardly taken to require a post-syntactic approach to inflectional morphology (Halle & Marantz (1993)). Given that by now a substantial amount of empirical evidence in support of such an operation has been accumulated, impoverishment can be viewed as a good argument in favour of the post-syntactic approach, given a Chomskyan Y-model of grammar in which inflectional morphology is an autonomous component of grammar. Against this background, the main goal of the present contribution is to show that a pre-syntactic approach to impoverishment becomes available if the complete well-formed sets of morpho-syntactic features that are required in any non-syntactic realizational approach to inflectional morphology (Stump (2001), Inkelas (2016)) are not given a declarative characterization (as is normally assumed), but arise incrementally, by iterated addition of features. On this view, pre-syntactic impoverishment is actually late addition of context features, giving rise to premature exponence. Consequently, the interaction between impoverishment and morphological exponence is not one of bleeding (as in post-syntactic approaches) but one of counter-feeding. While pre-syntactic impoverishment is basically a mirror image of post-syntactic impoverishment, it turns out to be more restrictive since it cannot affect inherent features: Features that are not added cannot be added late. This prediction is confirmed by evidence from gender and inflection class. Finally, the new concept of impoverishment is implemented in a pre-syntactic model of inflectional morphology based on Harmonic Serialism (Mueller (2020)).",0
"This paper introduces a semantically and pragmatically oriented typological generalization, which is named the orientation principle. It entails that the

by this insight is proposed as an alternative to processing approaches.",0
"The typology of lexicalizations in natural languages is highly skewed: some meanings repeatedly receive their own expression as individual morphemes or words in language after language, while many other meanings rarely or never do. For example, while many languages have monomorphemic counterparts of English 'some' and 'all', no known language has a monomorphemic quantifier that means 'all or none' or a quantifier that asserts that its two arguments are of the same cardinality. It seems tempting to reason from this typological skew to properties of stored representations. However, it is not generally safe to assume that if something is typologically unattested then it simply cannot be represented or learned. The representational system for stored denotations is just one of several interacting factors that affect the typology, and other factors such as communicative pressure and learnability are likely to shape patterns of lexicalization. In this paper we propose to reason from the typology to stored representations by modeling the representational framework, communicative pressure, and learnability directly within an evolutionary model, building on work by Brochhagen et al. (2018). Our empirical focus is a lexicalization asymmetry noted by Horn (1972) in the domain of logical operators and framed within the Aristotelian Square of Opposition. We show that, on certain assumptions, Horn's lexicalization pattern depends on very particular representational costs in the lexicon: it arises if the storage costs for 'every' and 'some' are lower than those for 'not every' and 'not some' but not otherwise.",0
"This paper argues for a unification of two seemingly unrelated phenomena from unrelated language families: Verb Second in Germanic, and Conjunct vs. Independent Order in Algonquian. It is argued that both reflect the possibility of the verb moving to C. While in Germanic this results in word order differences, in Algonquian V-to-C movement is only detectable via morphological alternations in agreement morphology. Under this view, Conjunct/Independent agreement and V2 are merely distinct reflexes of the same underlying process. This opens up new avenues of research in relation to V-to-C movement, framing it as a parametric option with potentially very different surface results in different languages depending on the setting of other parameters.",0
"The distribution of a special agreement pattern known as the ""inverse"" varies across the Algonquian languages. This paper shows that, under an interaction and satisfaction model of phi-agreement (Deal 2015), twelve distinct distributions of inverse agreement can be derived simply by varying the interaction and satisfaction conditions of the probe on Infl. This syntax-based approach to agreement variation has strong predictive power: it not only accounts for the twelve attested patterns but also rules out the unattested patterns, a result that a less restrictive postsyntactic approach cannot deliver. The Algonquian data thus provide support for a syntactic model of agreement patterns in general, and for the interaction and satisfaction model in particular.",1
"This chapter investigates the relation between syntheticity and analyticity in the history of Romanian. We empirically note that, against the traditional hypothesis that in the passage from Latin to Romance older synthetic forms were extensively replaced by novel analytic formations, there is a set of old Romanian periphrastic constructions which disappeared in the passage to modern Romanian, and we set our goal to provide an explanation for this less frequent linguistic change. By bringing to the fore data from old and modern Romanian, as well as dialectal Daco-Romanian material, we show that the facts are best explained by appealing to structural factors (i.e. the feature matrix of Romanian auxiliaries) rather than functional factors (competition between functionally equivalent forms, learnèd nature, or rare occurrence in usage)",0
"A'ingae (or Cofán, ISO 639-3: con) is an Amazonian isolate spoken in northeast Ecuador and southern Colombia. This paper describes and analyzes phonological processes pertinent to the glottal stop in A'ingae morphologically complex verbs. A'ingae verbal suffixes are organized in two morphophonological domains, or strata. Within the inner domain, glottal stops assign stress to the syllable which contains the second mora to the left of the glottal stop. In the outer domain, glottal stops do not have any effect on stress. In addition, some verbal suffixes delete stress (they are dominant). Dominance is unpredictable and independent of the suffix's morphophonological domain, but dominance and phonological stratification interact in a non-trivial way: Stress-deleting suffixes of the inner domain also delete glottalization, but stress-deleting suffixes of the outer domain leave glottalization intact.

The main theoretical import of the study resides in the architecture of the A'ingae grammar, which requires a phonological formalism capable of (i) modeling phonological stratification while (ii) allowing for morpheme-specific phonological idiosyncrasies which (iii) interact with the phonological grammar of their stratum. The formalism I adopt is Cophonologies by Phase (henceforth CbP; e.g. Sande, Jenks, and Inkelas, 2020). CbP fulfills the above desiderata by associating cophonologies, or morphologically-specific phonological grammars, with (i) phase heads as well as (ii) individual morphosyntactic features, which (iii) compile together to yield the phonological ranking applied at spell-out.

Secondary theoretical implications pertain to Goldsmith's (1990) notion of segmental licensing and Alderete's (1999, 2001) AntiFaithfulness. To model the relationship between glottalization and stress, I propose that within the inner (but not the outer) domain, the glottal stop is licensed by a metrical foot. I model stress deletion as antifaithfulness to input stress. Finally, I propose that antifaithfulness to a licenser entails antifaithfulness to its licensees, which captures the fact that only the inner dominant suffixes delete glottalization.",0
"We present a theory of conversion in terms of phrasal spellout. In this approach, there are no zero morphemes. Instead, the 'silent' meaning components are pronounced cumulatively within overt morphemes. As an empirical case, we discuss adjective/verb ambiguity as in 'narrow'. As verbs, these roots have both an inchoative and a causative  sense. Following Ramchand (2008), we assume that such de-adjectival causatives contain three parts: the adjective denoting a state, a change-of-state component PROC, and a causative component INIT. Adopting a Nanosyntax approach, we propose that verbs like 'narrow' spell out a complex node with all these abstract heads. The ambiguity between the inchoative, causative and adjective falls out as a consequence of the Superset Principle(Starke 2009), which states that a lexical entry can spell out any subtree it contains. Since both the inchoative sense and the adjective sense correspond to proper parts of the causative one, we derive these readings without the need to postulate zeroes. We show how these assumptions allow us to capture the different patterns of the inchoative/causative alternation that are known from the typological literature.",1
"In this paper, I will examine a number of less well-studied phenomena in Georgian over the course of its long written history, as well as a number of highly divergent nonstandard dialects of the modern language. This will look at both features that lead to an aggregate increase in morphological complexity, such the decline of tmesis in preverbs and their ultimate grammaticalization onto the verb, allowing for the possibility of 'trapped morphology' in the terms of Harris and Faarlund (2006). While such processes result in a net increase of morphological complexity, there also exist countervailing declines in morphological complexity in other ways, such as with the loss of –(e)n plural number agreement. Then there are cases of 'ambivalent' grammaticalization, such as clitic agreement and aspectual-modality markers (=q'e, =mca, =dzi) which never quite 'made it', as well as various phonological changes in dialects which have had some rather serious knock-on effects to verb morphology. Georgian verbal morphology will be seen to be not a fixed unchanging template, but a kaleidoscope of multisystemic, ongoing morphological change.",0
"In the broadest possible sense, case stacking can be defined as a phenomenon where a noun (or a pronoun, adjective) is followed by two or more adjacent case markers. This chapter focuses on two central issues related to case stacking. The first issue is under what morphosyntactic conditions case stacking arises (e.g., agreement, ellipsis, phrasal case marking; multiple case assignment). The second issue is what the morphosyntactic consequences of case stacking are (the appearance of 'dummy' morphemes; deletion of case morphemes; the fusion of consecutive case morphemes).",0
"I show that in Digor Ossetic, an agglutinative Eastern Iranian language spoken in the Caucasus, the nominal singular morpheme has a non-null allomorph -ɐ. I provide evidence that this morpheme does not cumulatively expone any other morphological feature. However, it occurs with both count and non-count nouns and therefore does not express singulative semantics. I provide a Distributed Morphology analysis of number marking in Digor Ossetic and show that the morph -ɐ spells out Num0. I observe that overt dedicated marking of the singular and the plural also exists in Emai and Ò̩ko̩, Edoid languages of Nigeria, and, as was recently shown, in Kipsigis (Nilotic). Accordingly, overt dedicated marking of the singular is likely to be a robustly attested phenomenon, which provides an additional argument in favor of treating of the singular as one of the values of a binary feature, rather than an absence of a feature.",0

In particular, -de is treated as a prepositional categorizer instead of a regular preposition. The analysis proposed in this article is shown to fare better than Li's.",0
"This chapter discusses the form of plural nominals in Argentinian Sign Language (LSA). In LSA, the plural of certain nouns is expressed through sidewards reduplication of the nominal base, while in other cases the reduplication pattern surfaces over a classifier form. We contend that this distinction is phonologically conditioned. We argue that there is a single plural morph in LSA, which involves repetitions of an arc-like movement. This element is an affix that rejects nominal bases with complex movements or a fixed place of articulation. Whenever affixation is not possible, an epenthetic operation of handshape insertion introduces a proper phonological host for the plural affix, i.e., a classifier, which captures the distribution of these forms regarding plural nouns. Moreover, we show that the ipsilaterality of sidewards reduplication is not part of the underlying phonological representation of the plural morph but obtains through a process of movement epenthesis.",1
"In the Minimalist enterprise, the existence of roots is not taken as a tenet, these being generally assumed by non-lexicalist / neoconstructivist approaches to grammar such as DM and the Exoskeletal Model. Nevertheless, the assumption of a separate primitive dedicated to hosting extra-grammatical information - as opposed to functional primitives, such as syntactic features - is entirely compatible with the Minimalist Program, once it paves the way for an in-depth evaluation of the interplay of the lexicon with other components of the Faculty of Language (FL). Assuming roots to be grammatical primitives brings to the forefront of linguistic minimalism the question of what the 'atoms' of syntactic computation are, since it demands a rigorous investigation of which properties are inherent to them and which are emergent (i.e., contextually derived), as well as whether their superficial features are packaged as a whole in the same grammatical component.",1
"Cross-linguistically, affix order is commonly determined by semantic scope (Rice 2006) or a morphological template. Less frequently, affix order is free, which means that suffixes can be reordered without a concomitant change in scope. To address the question of what gives rise to and constrains free affix order (FAO), I present a case study of Paraguayan Guaraní (or PG, Tupí-Guaraní, Paraguay, ISO 639-3: gug). I argue that FAO in PG should be analyzed as driven by prosodic factors. The prosodic analysis has previously been proposed only for Chintang (Bickel et al. 2007). Two major analyses of FAO see the phenomenon as driven by either morphology (e.g. Ryan 2010) or prosody (Bickel et al. 2007). The morphological analysis proposes that FAO is a consequence of free variation within the morphological template. The prosodic analysis models FAO with prosodic subcategorization for phonologically prominent positions. I argue that the two analyses make different predictions as to the preconditions for and the extent of FAO. I show that both the morphological and the prosodic profile of FAO are attested. I propose that FAO in PG is an instance of the latter. Thus, I demonstrate that FAO is not a unified phenomenon, but rather should be typologized as driven by either morphological or prosodic factors.",1
"In Paraguayan Guaraní (Tupian, ISO 639-3: gug), suffix order is determined by several factors, including syntactic scope, morphotactic restrictions, free variation, and prosody.

Paraguayan Guaraní suffixes form two syntactic classes: predicate-level suffixes and clause-level suffixes. Both syntactic classes include stressable and stressless suffixes. Predicate-level suffixes typically precede clause-level suffixes. However, stressable suffixes always precede stressless ones. Furthermore, within both groups (stressable or stressless), the order of suffixes is largely free.

I propose that stressable suffixes are independently prosodified phonological words and stressless suffixes are non-prosodified. I analyze the Paraguayan Guaraní suffix order as an interaction of mirroring between the order of suffixes and the order of syntactic operations, on the one hand, and prosodic subcategorization and demands on phonological well-formedness, on the other. Thus, I document and analyze an unusual agglutinating system, whose highly non-prototypical prosodified and freely-ordered suffixes challenge the notion of a phonological word, contributing to ongoing research on phonological and syntactic domains as well as the interfaces of phonology, morphology, and syntax.",0

"This paper looks at the case of so-called neutral roots in Uyghur (Turkic: China), whose idiosyncratic behavior with respect to the backness harmony system has been analyzed as stemming from a covert vowel contrast. Based on considerations of the structural properties of the language and the results of an experimental study, we suggest that an analysis based on lexical exceptionality is more parsimonious than the traditional analysis, unifying the treatment of neutral roots with other cases of exceptionality in the harmony system and accounting for a relationship between the patterning of roots and their frequency. We close by discussing implications for covert contrast analyses in general.",0
"Subcortical contributions to core linguistic computations pertaining to syntax-semantics remain drastically under-studied. We critique the cortico-centric focus which has largely accompanied research into these higher-order linguistic functions and suggest that, while much remains unknown, there is nevertheless a rich body of research concerning the possible roles of subcortex in natural language. Although much current evidence emerges from distinct domains of cognitive neuroscience, in this review article we attempt to show that there is a clear place for subcortex in models of natural language syntax-semantics, including a role in binary set-formation, categorized object maintenance, lexico-semantic processing, conceptual-to-lexical transformations, morphosyntactic linearization, semantic feature-binding, and cross-cortical representational integration. In particular, we consult models of language processing relying on oscillatory brain dynamics in order to investigate both the apparent and possible functional roles of subcortex in language.",0
"Choctaw shows a 'Case OCP' effect, which bans adjacent clausemate nouns from carrying the same case-marker (Broadwell 2006). I refine the description of the Case OCP, showing (a) that it does not hold over clause boundaries, (b) that it only regulates the co-occurrence of NPs whose case-markers take the same morphophonological form (ignoring NPs bearing only the same abstract case features), and (c) that it is sensitive to the syntactic function of the case-marker, failing to hold when the same suffix is used to mark switch-reference. I argue that such a constraint is most compatible with a parallel model of the morphological component of the grammar, wherein input syntactic structure and output morphophonological form are visible simultaneously. I provide further evidence that the Case OCP is housed in a parallel morphological component by showing that it is violable in certain circumstances. I provide an implementation of Choctaw's Case OCP within Optimality Theory. Finally, I compare the Choctaw Case OCP with the Japanese Double-o Constraint, highlighting some points of agreement and difference.",0
"When the semantics is underspecified for some range of meaning, i.e. the grammar fails to
display the full range of signs (words and syntax) required for semantic interpretation,
compositionality across the relevant range is non-transparent. Pirahã tense is interesting because
non-transparent temporal interpretations in Pirahã require more information than the syntax (or
the pragmatics) provides. Moreover, not only are temporal interpretations in Pirahã
underdetermined by Pirahã syntax, but this underdetermination provides yet more evidence
against what one might label ""naive compositionality"" - the idea that meanings are provided
Montague-style by mappings from syntax to semantics. Indeed, as we see, underspecified
temporal semantics calls into question the very nature of compositionality itself. However, if we
reinterpret compositionality as a subtype of inference in the Peircean sense, we are able not only
to better understand some pecularities in the relationship between Pirahã language and cognition
but to also predict (as per Everett 2017 and Barham and Everett 2020) ""degrees of fit"" between
morphosyntactic structures, meanings, and cultures across languages, leading to an informal
typology of language types that includes languages without sentential recursion (e.g., but not
limited to, Pirahã). Finally, Pirahã temporal semantics is also interesting because it forces an
adjustment of Reichenbach's theory of tense, in line with Everett (1993), namely, that the
""Reference"" coordinate in his system is dispensable in some languages.",0

"This revision of a PowerPoint presentation from a University of British Columbia talk on 4 March 2021 outlines how a phonologically driven theory of grammar (Schmerling 1983a, b, 2019) explains apparent misalignments of syntactic and prosodic structures as resulting from operations that substitute units of varying weight at prosodic edges, applying bottom to top in the formation of larger structures. On this approach, syntax is semantically relevant relations among prosodic structures . This theory is a generalization to units larger than prosodic words of the item and process morphology of Edward Sapir and his students. A Sapirian perspective on the relationship between grammar and phonology allows us to view ""bracketing paradoxes"" identified to date as involving generalized affixations, i.e., as operations that increment prosodic words within prosodic phrases. An appropriately broad perspective on the sound grammar relationship lets us see such affixations as akin to widely attested substitutions of units that are properly contained in words, like the mutations of Celtic initial consonants
or of syllable nuclei as in Germanic umlaut and Indo European and Penutian ablaut. A grammatical architecture in which formation operations apply directly to phonological structures allows us to revisit our conception of the motivation for syntactic categories, which can now be seen as divorced from units properly seen as prosodic and which are thus applicable to languages traditionally seen as typologically incommensurate. A further advantage of this approach to linguistic structure is its ability to explain lexicalization of linguistic expressions as simply entailing a prosodic structure (initially) ceasing to be derived according to some formation rule.",0
"This article is concerned with the derivation of morphological aspect in Russian and Czech. It investigates four aspectual markers: prefixes, the secondary imperfective suffix, the semelfactive marker and the habitual suffix. It argues that not only in Russian (see Tatevosov 2011, 2015) but also in Czech aspect interpretation is separated from prefixes and the secondary imperfective suffix. Moreover, it extends the separation to the semelfactive suffix and the habitual marker. Specific morphological aspect properties of Russian and Czech predicates are derived by an Agree analysis with minimality based on dominance relations in
the complex verbal head.",0

"Alphabetical writing systems use letters that are closely related to speech to record speech. However, the glyphs of Chinese characters do not directly express sounds, and the ideographic mechanism between the glyphs and their meanings is not transparent. We analysed the relationship between the glyphs and meanings of nine thousand Chinese characters and found that the combination of elements in the glyph constructs certain imagery, and this imagery is a psychological representation of the experience informing the concept of the character, so the meaning and glyph of the characters are ideographically connected. We use the many related meanings derived from the configuration to infer the imagery of the configuration, so that this imagery can explain the meanings of the characters. In the end, we found out the imagery and structure these nine thousand Chinese characters, summarized the five combination modes of Chinese characters, and extended these combination modes to multi-character words combining characters and characters. These results reveal the ideographic mechanism of the hierarchical combination of the internal structure of Chinese characters and their imagery, unearth the interpretable imagery and knowledge that directly represent the meaning of Chinese characters, and help propose a guiding theory for character word formation in the Chinese writing system.",0
"Phonologically conditioned suppletive allomorphy (PCSA) may be phonologically
optimizing: allomorph selection complies with the language phonotactics. However this is not
always the case. A counterexample often discussed in the literature is Haitian determiner a/la.
This paper further investigates Haitian by focusing on a PCSA pattern in Northern Haitian
that has not yet been discussed in the theoretical literature: third person singular pronoun i/li.
The paper argues that this pattern can be analyzed as morphologically optimizing: allomorph
selection in this case can be understood as a way to facilitate morpheme identification in
context. The pattern presents a further interesting property: allomorph selection interacts with
a phonologically optimizing process (pronoun reduction from i to y [j] and from li to l ). This
interaction can be straightforwardly modeled in an analysis assuming parallel morphological
and phonological optimizations, but not in a serial model where the morphology precedes the
phonology and has no access to the output of phonological optimization.",1
"In this paper, which discusses data from Gargano Apulian Italo-Romance, I propose that prepositional and non-prepositional genitives are fundamentally two different types of phrases, and that the interpretation of a non-prepositional noun as the possessor is not due to a silent preposition or head-modifier inversion, but rather to an agreement mechanism taking place between the modifier and its head. We propose that, just as a genitive can agree with its head for gender and number features so it can for definiteness, and that agreement for definiteness yields a genitival interpretation of the non-prepositional noun. I.e., definiteness can externalize the syntactic relation between head and modifier. We also propose that in this Apulian variety, non-prepositional genitives are syntactic phases (Chomsky 2001), and that the same holds for non-prepositional 'qualitative' predicative phrases in the same language. This would explain the impossibility of accessing the phrase through syntactic operations such as extraction.",1
"The chapter investigates past participles in Czech. Specifically, I focus on the variation of the shape of the past participle morpheme in the colloquial variety of Czech. The variation poses a morphophonological puzzle: it involves apocope of the past participle suffix -l, which is however not a regular phonological process in colloquial Czech. The puzzle is explained in terms of licensing consonant domains (Scheer 2009, Cyran 2010) which have different parameters in each language variety.",0
"The unification of inflectional and derivational morphology is an issue that is often debated but on which there is no consensus. On the other hand, it is well known that inflectional morphology is organized into paradigms. This paper contributes to the convergence between inflection and derivation by offering a new paradigmatic model of derivational morphology. This model, called ParaDis, is based on two types of objects, families and paradigms, and on an architecture made up of three levels of representation (formal, categorical and semantic) and a morphological level, which connects the other three. Morphological descriptions are distributed at three levels, where they organize into formal, categorical and semantic families and paradigms. In this way, the analysis of a phenomenon adjusts closely to its level-specific regularities. The paper describes ParaDis and shows how it can be used to analyze a wide range of canonical and non-canonical derivational constructions in a simple and intuitive way. It compares ParaDis to five frameworks (Bochner, 1993; Bonami & Strnadová, 2019; Booij, 2010; Jackendoff & Audring, 2020b; Koenig, 1999) and illustrates its contributions through the analysis of parasynthetic derivatives.",0
"[This is a language sketch of the Tsimshianic family oriented toward non-specialists, with reference to topics in phonetics, phonology, syntax, and semantics.]

Languages of the Tsimshianic family, spoken in the Skeena River watershed of British Columbia, share a number of properties with other languages of the Pacific northwest region. Their sound inventories feature glottal consonants, and they permit clusters of consonants without vowels. Their word order is verb-first (VSO), and a central property of the grammar is a robust system of plural marking on both nouns and verbs. This chapter reviews topics in the sound system, word formation, and sentence building. In particular, I review two topics that commanded the majority of linguists' attention until about a decade ago: glottalized sounds, and the agreement/pronoun system. This second is a complicated core area of the grammar, particularly for an L1 English learner, and is perhaps unique to Tsimshianic: linguists have described the pattern as one of 'pivoting ergativity' across two types of clauses. In the course of discussing sounds, words, and sentences, I also briefly review some more recent lines of linguistic work of interest to language learning and teaching: the placement of stress, mismatches between words and syntactic units, plural marking, tense and perspective, and ways to form questions and convey emphasis.",0
"Standard Icelandic has the reciprocal hvor annar 'each other' and the distributives hvor sinn 'each their' and sinn hvor 'their each' (the latter two being largely synonymous). The two parts of these expressions are case distinct and also positionally split by a preposition, when there is one, as in, for example, hvor um annan, lit. ""each.NOM about other.ACC"" = 'about each other'. The positional properties and the case marking patterns of these standard Icelandic expressions are cross-linguistically rare. In roughly the last two centuries, though, everyday Icelandic has developed innovative and less exotic reciprocals and distributives, where the two parts of the expressions are adjacent (as in most related languages) and commonly case congruent, as in um hvorn annan 'about each.ACC other.ACC', or, in the case of the distributives, um sitthvorn, lit. ""about their-each.ACC"". In this paper, we report on a corpus study of these innovative reciprocals and distributives and discuss how they relate to the traditional standard expressions. We propose that the traditional expressions are derived by what we refer to as e-raising, whereby the first of the two items involved, most commonly hvor, is raised from its base position to
the base position of its antecedent prior to case marking, thereby getting the same case as its antecedent. The major difference between the old and the new expressions is that the latter lack e-raising.",1
"A'ingae (or Cofán, ISO 639-3: con) is a language isolate spoken in the Ecuadorian and Colombian Amazon. This study presents a description and analysis of the language's morphologically-conditioned verbal stress assignment. Specifically, I show that A'ingae verbal morphemes can be classified with two binary parameters: the presence or lack of prestressing and the presence or lack of stress deletion (i.e. dominance), which vary independently.

I formalize my analysis in Cophonology Theory (Anttila, 1997; Inkelas, 1998; Inkelas, Orgun, and Zoll, 1997; Orgun, 1996; others), a non-representational theory of the phonology-morphology interface, which captures morpheme-specific phonology with constraint rankings particularized to morphological constructions.

I argue that while non-representational approaches, such as Cophonology Theory, can handle the facts of A'ingae stress deletion straightforwardly, representational approaches (Jaker and Kiparsky, 2020; Kushnir, 2019; Smolensky and Goldrick, 2016; Trommer and Zimmermann, 2014; others) lack the expressive power necessary to capture the A'ingae stress facts.",0

"I describe and analyze conditional constructions in  A'ingae (or Cofán, ISO 639-3: con), an indigenous language isolate of the Amazon. In addition to compositional and non-compositional properties, A'ingae conditionals have properties that straddle the line between the two extremes, reusing formal devices or reimplementing semantic distinctions which exist in other parts of the grammar. I provide a constructional analysis of the data and argue that it can accommodate the idiosyncrasies of A'ingae conditionals, while capturing the semantic and formal generalization at all the relevant levels.

Finally, negative epistemic stance in conditional constructions is encoded using a similative morpheme. The primary function of the similative is to express qualitative comparison. I observe that comparison requires considering a distanced mental space. I argue that in distanced conditionals, the similative has undergone semantic bleaching to convey mental space distance only.",0

"In this paper, we investigate the relation between head movement and the synthesis-periphrasis distinction in the verbal domain. We use the term ""synthesis"" to refer to verbal expressions in which the lexical verb bears all the verbal inflection in a clause. In contrast, a periphrastic verbal expression additionally contains an auxiliary verb (""be"" or ""have""), and verbal inflection is distributed between the lexical verb and the auxiliary. We argue for a one-way correlation between head movement and periphrasis, first observed in Pietraszko 2017, which we refer to as the ""Synthesis-Movement Generalization"": If the lexical verb moves to T, it must form a synthetic expression with T, that is, periphrasis is impossible. Importantly, the inverse correlation doesn't hold, as synthesis is compatible with, but does not entail, head movement of the lexical verb to T. We argue that existing theories of the synthesis/periphrasis distinction are either too weak and predict no correlation at all, or too strong and predict a two-way correlation. We further argue that the Synthesis-Movement Generalization can be explained by the hypothesis that both head movement and periphrasis are related to selection. More specifically, we propose that head movement is parasitic on a selectional relation (following Svenonius 1994, Matushansky 2006, and Preminger 2019) and that periphrasis is Merge of an auxiliary verb triggered by a selectional feature of T (Déchaine 1995, Cowper 2010, Pietraszko 2017). This analysis derives the complementarity of head movement of the lexical verb to T and the presence of an auxiliary from the fact that T's selectional feature can be satisfied by the lexical verb or an auxiliary, but not both. If T's selectional requirement is satisfied by an auxiliary, it's not satisfied by the lexical verb, so the lexical verb can't undergo head movement to T.",0
"This paper aims to understand the syntax of causative constructions in Sason Arabic. It demonstrates that in geminate causatives and 'give'-causatives, the causee is introduced in CauseeP, unlike the embedded agent in 'make'-causatives, which embed a thematic VoiceP. Despite differing from Voice in several respects, Causee also exhibits an active-passive-like alternation, providing independent evidence for an analysis of the passive that treats it as a subtype of the Voice head (Legate 2014; Legate et al. 2020; Akkus 2021a). The paper further distinguishes between geminates and 'give'-causatives on the basis of the (in)compatibility of the causee with an applied argument. In geminates, Causee and Appl are bundled, and the same argument bears two θ-roles, whereas in other causative constructions, Causee and Appl remain separate, with each argument bearing a distinct θ-role.",0
"Studies have shown that ""framing bias,"" a phenomenon in which two different presentations of the same decision-making problem provoke different answers, is reduced in a foreign language (the Foreign Language effect, FLe). Three explanations have emerged to account for the difference. First, the cognitive enhancement hypothesis states that lower proficiency in the FL leads to more deliberate processing, reducing the framing bias. Second, contradicting the previous, the cognitive overload hypothesis, states that the cognitive load actually induces speakers to make less rational decisions in the FL. Finally, the reduced emotionality hypothesis suggests that speakers have less of an emotional connection to a foreign language (FL), causing an increase in rational language processing. Previous FLe research has involved both FL and non-FL speakers such as highly proficient acculturated bilinguals. Our study extends this research program to a population of heritage speakers of Spanish (HS speakers), whose second language (English) is dominant and who have comparable emotional resonances in both of their languages. We compare emotion-neutral and emotion-laden tasks: if reduced emotionality causes the FLe, it should only be present in emotion-laden tasks, but if it is caused by cognitive load, it should be present across tasks. Ninety-eight HS speakers, with varying degrees of proficiency in Spanish, exhibited cognitive biases across a battery of tasks: framing bias appeared in both cognitive-emotional and purely cognitive tasks, consistent with previous studies. Language of presentation (and proficiency) did not have a significant effect on responses in cognitive-emotional tasks, but did have an effect on the purely-cognitive Disjunction fallacy task: HS speakers did better in their second, more proficient language, a result consistent with neither the reduced emotionality hypothesis nor the cognitive enhancement hypothesis. Moreover, higher proficiency in Spanish significantly improved the rate of correct responses, indicating that our results are more consistent with the cognitive overload hypothesis",0
"A recent proposal attributes morphosyntactic issues in L2 to lexical factors (Grüter et al. 2012; Hopp 2013). According to this lexical account, issues with gender agreement are caused by gender assignment issues – a failure to assign a word to a target-like class. We elaborate on this idea by exploring three potential cues to gender assignment: 1) semantic gender relating to sex (e.g. 'girl' vs. 'boy') 2) morphophonological cues, and 3) morphosyntactic agreement cues. Semantic and morphophonological cues may facilitate gender agreement only for a subset of nouns, whereas agreement cues can do so for all nouns, including opaque gender nouns that do not have semantic gender.

Seventeen low proficiency and sixteen high proficiency L1 English L2 Spanish speakers and eighteen native Spanish controls judged the grammaticality of 60 experimental sentences. We compared participants' gender agreement accuracy and reaction times (RTs) on experimental items with and without semantic gender, and with and without transparent gender morphemes. Semantic gender did not serve as a cue for gender assignment/agreement; instead, it slowed down RTs in high proficiency and control participants. Morphophonological cues significantly increased accuracy and decreased RTs in all groups. Finally, agreement cues did not seem to help low proficiency learners, since their accuracy on opaque nouns was barely above chance. By contrast, high proficiency learners exhibited native-like accuracy on opaque nouns. These findings support the lexical accounts of L2 gender agreement difficulties, adding more data to the growing body of research in this field.",1
"Grammont's (1914) influential Law of Three Consonants (LTC) states that French schwa is obligatorily pronounced in any CC_C sequence to avoid three-consonant clusters. Later works have shown that schwa presence is also sensitive to the nature of the consonants involved, at least at the word and phrase levels. However the LTC is still generally considered as accurate under its original formulation to describe schwa-zero alternations at the stem level. The goal of the paper is to test whether the LTC should be relaxed even in this context. The paper presents two studies using judgment data to compare the behavior of schwa in derived words (stem-level phonology) and in inflected words (word-level phonology). The results of the two studies show that the nature of consonants involved in the CC_C sequence plays a role at both stem and word levels. Moreover, the same phonotactic asymmetries among consonant clusters are found in both contexts. The data therefore support a weaker version of the stem-level vs. word-level divide than what is usually assumed for French. This conclusion is strengthened by the results of a modeling study showing that a constraint-based grammar with the same phonotactic constraints across stem- and word-level phonologies provides a better fit to the judgment data from Study 1 and Study 2 than a grammar with different phononotactic constraints in the two morphosyntactic domains. The paper also replicates a number of earlier findings on the role of morphosyntactic domains, clash avoidance, and dialectal variation in schwa-zero alternations.",0
"This paper describes the structure and creation of Blackfoot Words, a new relational database of lexical forms (words, stems, and morphemes) in Blackfoot (Algonquian; ISO 639-3: bla). To date, we have digitized 62,693 individual lexical forms from 26 sources, representing all four major dialects, and spanning the years 1743–2017. Version 1 of the database includes lexical forms from nine of these sources.
This project has two aims. The first is to digitize and provide access to the lexical data in these sources, many of which are difficult to access and discover. The second is to organize the data so that connections can be made between instances of the ""same"" lexical form across all sources, despite variation across sources in the dialect recorded, orthographic conventions, and the depth of morpheme analysis. The database structure was developed in response to these aims.
The database comprises five tables: Sources, Words, Stems, Morphemes, and Lemmas. The Sources table contains bibliographic information and commentary on the sources. The Words table contains inflected words in the source orthography. Each word is broken down into stems and morphemes which are entered into the Stems and Morphemes tables in the source orthography. The Lemmas table contains abstract versions of each stem or morpheme in a standardized orthography. Instances of the same stem or morpheme are linked to a common lemma. We expect that the database will support projects by the language community and other researchers.",0

"The Manuscript and the meandering Mind. Academia Letters. 
This article answers frequent inquiry about how the solutions were found for the writing system and language of Medieval manuscript MS408, as described in the peer-reviewed Romance Studies journal paper titled: The Language and Writing System of MS408 (Voynich) Explained: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02639904.2019.1599566 As finding the solutions was largely intuitive, then explaining how it was done is something of a challenge in and of itself.",0
"The paper argues for a view of gender agreement without either grammatical or natural gender being represented as syntactic features. Rather than deriving declension classes in terms of realisation, I postulate them as the only relevant feature that is lexically specified on the noun. Agreement copies the declension class and triggers presuppositions. When these presuppositions clash with those already active in the discourse, default agreement is realised. The paper moreover provides a quantitative analysis of semantic correlates of declension classes and a novel division of the SC case endings across declension classes in light of syncretism.",0
"Cross-linguistically, affix order is commonly determined by semantic scope (Rice, 2006) or a morphological template. Less frequently, affix order is free, which means that suffixes can be reordered without a concomitant change in scope. To address the question of what gives rise to and constrains free affix order (FAO), I present a case study of Paraguayan Guaraní (or PG, Tupí-Guaraní, Paraguay, ISO 639-3: gug). I argue that FAO in PG should be analyzed as driven by prosodic factors. The prosodic analysis has previously been proposed only for Chintang (Bickel et al., 2007).

Two major analyses of FAO see the phenomenon as driven by either morphology (e.g. Ryan, 2010) or prosody (Bickel et al., 2007). The morphological analysis proposes that FAO is a consequence of free variation within the morphological template. The phonological analysis models FAO with prosodic subcategorization for phonologically prominent positions.

I argue that the two analyses make different predictions as to the preconditions for and the extent of FAO. I show that both the morphological and the prosodic profile of FAO are attested. I propose that FAO in PG is an instance of the latter. Thus, I demonstrate that FAO is not a unified phenomenon, but rather should be typologized as driven by either morphological or prosodic factors.",0
"In this squib, we propose that subcategorization at the exponent level must be deconstructed into (at least) two distinct conditions/mechanisms. We refer to this proposal as 'split subcategorization', which states that an exponent may have a condition on its insertion (a COIN) and/or a condition on its position (a COP), which (i) are formally independent of one another, (ii) operate over an overlapping but distinct set of primitives, and (iii) are ordered with respect to each other--COINs are satisfied before COPs. The first condition--the COIN--applies early, presumably at or soon after the spell-out of syntax, and governs suppletive exponent choice. The second condition--the COP--applies at a later point, and governs manipulations of exponent position, i.e., infixation. We contrast our proposal with an alternative we refer to as 'enriched subcategorization', which takes there to be one mechanism governing both infixation and suppletion, with their differences coming from enrichments to the (single) condition on an exponent's realization. On the basis of a number of theoretical and empirical considerations, we argue for the superiority of split subcategorization. Thus, subcategorization must be deconstructed even at the fine-grained level of interest here, as used to regulate individual exponents.",0
"Many Austronesian languages exhibit a type of verbal inflection known as 'voice' or 'focus,' which, in a descriptive sense, tracks the grammatical role of topics or relativized phrases. Comparative data from previously understudied languages reveals that such affixal alternations are best analyzed as the morphological realization of different bundles of A- and A-bar Agree relations probing the same goal (i.e. topics/relativized phrases). Similar portmanteau agreement is found in Nilotic and Caucasian, with four loci of variation attested: (a) presence or absence of φ-feature agreement with the goal, (b) number of voice distinctions (i.e. how many bundles of Agree relations are realised in narrow syntax), (c) the type of A-bar operations that trigger the hybrid agreement, and (d) whether the goal undergoes overt A-bar movement. I argue that this type of hybrid agreement is a feature of discourse configurationality (Li & Thompson 1985; É Kiss 1995; Miyagawa 2010), which functions to index the φ-agreement relation of the phrase simultaneously under Agree relation with an A ̄bar probe. If this analysis is on the right track, it reveals that φ-feature agreement is not the only available means of indicating abstract A-bar Agree relations, and that what is known as 'Austronesian-type voice' or 'wh-agreement' in the literature constitutes an understudied type of agreement that serves a similar purpose.",0
"It has been widely argued that words are analogous to species such that words, like species, are natural kinds. In this paper, I consider the metaphysics of word-kinds. After arguing against an essentialist approach, I argue that word-kinds are homeostatic property clusters, in line with the dominant approach to other biological and psychological kinds.",0
"In natural languages, closed-class items predict open-class items but not the other way around. For example, in English, if there is a determiner there will be a noun, but nouns can occur with or without determiners. Here we asked whether statistical learning of closed-class items is also asymmetrical. In three experiments we exposed adults to a miniature language with the one-way dependency ""if X then Y"": if X was present, Y was also present, but Y could occur without X. We created different versions of the language in order to ask whether learning depended on which category (X or Y) was an open or closed class. In one condition, X had the main properties of a closed class and Y had the main properties of an open class; in a contrasting condition, X had properties of an open class and Y had properties of a closed class. Learners' exposure in these two conditions was otherwise identical. Learning was significantly better with closed-class X. Additional experiments demonstrated that it is the perceptual distinctiveness of closed-class items that drives learners to analyze them differently, and that the mathematical relationship between closed- and open-class items influences learning more strongly than their linear order. These results suggest that statistical learning is biased: learners privilege computations in which closed-class items are predictive of, rather than predicted by, open-class items. We suggest that the distributional asymmetries of closed-class items in natural languages-and perhaps the asymmetrical structure of linguistic representations-may arise in part from this learning bias.",1
"Abstract: Despite certain complications stemming from the availability of both (i) optional
Differential Object Marking and (ii) (for some speakers) Exceptional Case Marking, Catalan like
Italian and French, displays a transitivity-sensitive pattern in causatives under FACERE whereby
the causee can be realised as dative only where its complement is 'transitive'. We propose an
analysis of this pattern based on Cyclic Agree (building on Bobaljik & Branigan 2006, Béjar &
Rezac 2009). On our approach, transitivity-sensitive dative arises where a probe agrees with a DP
which requires case licensing, having previously probed (potentially defectively) a closer XP of
any kind. Downward Cyclic Agree is possible, in this context, because neither goal c-commands
the other, making them both visible to a single higher probe. This model captures the basic
transitivity-sensitive pattern and the strict Person Case Constraint (PCC) effects observed in this
domain as well as the fact that dative is triggered not only by DPs requiring structural/dependent
case but also by 'defective interveners' (PPs, CPs, case-marked DPs/clitics). We show that this
Agree-based account has potential advantages over competing dependent-case approaches
because of its ability to handle: (i) c-command patterns between the causee and other arguments,
(ii) the behaviour of PP complements and (iii) the strict PCC effects observed under FACERE in
Catalan (and across Romance).",0
"Maithili is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language spoken by around 34 million people, primarily in India and Nepal (Yadava et al. 2019:41). Its agreement system, which includes portmanteau morphemes sensitive to the subject plus a non-subject secondary controller, is known for exhibiting some crosslinguistically rare properties. Notably, argument-internal possessors can control agreement, in seeming violation of standardly-assumed locality restrictions on agreement (Stump and Yadav 1988). In addition, agreement involves an intricate system of dedicated honorific features –- as opposed to non-honorific features recruited into an honorific system, which are the typical means of honorification crosslinguistically (see e.g. Wang 2020).

In this paper, we present an Agree-based analysis of the agreement system of one particular variety of Maithili, spoken in Siraha District of Province 2, Nepal (relying on data from Yadava et al. 2019). Our main claims are the following:

a. Maithili agreement exhibits a person/honorificity hierarchy effect which challenges standard cyclic Agree models (e.g. Béjar 2003, Deal 2015), and motivates a novel implementation of dynamic interaction (Deal 2021).

b. The language's four-way respect scale is split into two-way honorific and dishonorific systems.

c. Agreement with argument-internal possessors and PP-internal nominals is facilitated by focus-driven movement to the phase edge, analogous to the standard Agree-based analysis of cross-CP agreement (e.g. Polinsky and Potsdam 2001).",1
"The broad aim of this book is to bring a basic, but detailed description of Icelandic nominalizations to bear on the general theoretical and architectural issues that nominalizations have raised since the earliest work in generative syntax. While nominalization has long been central to theories of argument structure, and Icelandic has been an important language for the study of argument structure and syntax, Icelandic has not been brought into the general body of theoretical work on nominalization. In this book, I show that Icelandic-specific issues in the analysis of derived nominals have broad implications that go beyond the study of that one language. In particular, Icelandic provides special evidence that Complex Event Nominals (CENs), which seem to inherit their argument structure from the underlying verbs, can be formed without nominalizing a full verb phrase. This conclusion is at odds with prominent theories of nominalization which claim that CENs have the properties that they have precisely because they involve the nominalization of full verb phrases. More narrowly, I aim to develop the theory of allosemy within the framework of Distributed Morphology to account for the ambiguity of nominalizations and inheritance of argument structure. In so doing, I will show how one single syntactic structure can get distinct semantic interpretations corresponding to the range of readings that are available to derived nominals. The idea is that just as the phonological realization of terminal nodes is underspecified in syntax (so that before Vocabulary Insertion, past tense -ed and past tense -t are the same T[PAST] head), the semantic interpretation of terminal nodes is underspecified in syntax as well. Late insertion at LF inserts suppletive allosemes---semantic denotations---into terminal nodes that are underspecified semantically. I argue that the single structure at issue derives a noun from a verb before any arguments are attached, by adjoining a lexical root to a v(erb) head and adjoining the resulting verb to a n(oun) head. In addition to showing how an account grounded in allosemy can derive the ambiguity, I also explore the consequences of building nominalizations entirely with complex heads for the locality of special meanings, and articulate the function of prepositions and prefixing in Icelandic lexical meaning. 

The result is a broad argument for what Icelandic nominalizations tell us about argument structure and the syntax-semantics interface, along with an articulated theoretical proposal that makes several novel claims about the syntax-semantics interface within Distributed Morphology.

"This paper focuses on Istro-Romanian and argues that the TAM auxiliaries of this variety are not morphophonological clitics. This analysis is supported by the existence of several empirical phenomena (auxiliary-licensed VP-ellipsis, scrambling, and interpolation), some not found in modern Romance, others very rare in modern Romance. This property of Istro-Romanian auxiliary verbs accounts, in conjunction with other features of this variety (e.g., the availability of C-oriented and I-oriented pronominal clitics), for the massive variation in the word order of pronominal clitics, auxiliaries, and the lexical verb found in the Istro-Romanian sentential core. An endangered Romance variety spoken in Istria and in the diaspora, historically related to (Daco-)Romanian, Istro-Romanian has been in contact with Croatian since the settlement of Istro-Romanians in the Istrian peninsula. As some of the Istro-Romanian features and phenomena are found both in Croatian and in old Romanian, it appears that contact with Croatian acts as a catalyst of structural convergence engendering the retention of an archaic property of Istro-Romanian auxiliaries: a lower position on the grammaticalization cline, closer to the full word status of their etyma.",0
"The traditional description of Polish abstract nouns such as lekkość 'lightness' or
jasność 'brightness' holds that they are formed with an adjectival root and the nominalizing suffix -ość. The paper considers an alternative analysis where -o-ść is a complex marker and such nominals go through an adverbial stage in their formation, rendering them [[[A] Adv] N] structures, a possibility suggested by the fact that the -o itself is an adverbial marker.",0
"In varieties of Basque, objects embedded into absolutive- and dative-marked nominalised complement clauses can enter a long-distance agreement relation with the matrix auxiliary. The observed patterns are derived from the featural specifications and probing characteristics of different types of matrix probes: absolutive clauses appear opaquer because they are targeted by a person and a number probe, the former restricting the range of possible goals for the latter, while dative clauses seem more transparent because they are targeted by an integral probe, which, as a consequence of its integrity, is 'stubborn', and able to penetrate domains inaccessible to single-feature absolutive probes.",0
"Amharic has different types of complement clauses. These complement clause types are selected by different classes of verbs. The current paper sets out to study how exactly the selection of the complement clauses works.

In contrast to English and many other languages where the types of complementizers heading over the complement clauses appear to determine the selection, the complementizers have little direct role on the selection mechanism in Amharic. The important attribute for the selection turn out to be the features available in the sub-CP domain. For a class of verbs selecting finite complement clause, the perfective aspect appears to be the crucial feature, whereas the imperfective feature is the target of nonfinite clause selecting predicates. 

This kind of nonlocal kind of selection is at odds with the standard assumption that selection is effected with a strictly local relationships between the selector and the selectee SOs. In this paper, I will argue that while the selection relation appears to be nonlocal, the locality assumption can still be saved if we allow Agree relationship to be established between the lower functional layers of the complement domain and the C head.",0
"We investigate optional predicate agreement in Santiago Tz'utujil (Mayan). We show that all the features of the agreement controller must be exponed in some structural configurations, whereas a 3rd singular morpheme can be exponed in others. Several generalizations emerge: (i) inanimate arguments base generated as complements control agreement optionally; (ii) a subset of animate arguments base-generated as complements control agreement optionally; and (iii) all arguments base-generated as specifiers control full agreement obligatorily. These generalizations lead us to propose that two conditions must be met in order for AGREE to succeed, resulting in the exponence of all the features of the agreement controller. First, a goal must be visible (i.e., bear the feature that the probe is looking for). Second, a goal must be accessible (i.e., be in the right structural position to be targeted by the probe). If one or both of these conditions are not met, AGREE fails, but the derivation converges and 3rd singular agreement is exponed. In other words, while the syntactic operation AGREE is deterministic, surface optionality arises when the operation fails. A consequence of our proposal is that optional agreement serves as a diagnostic for underlying syntactic  structure. In applying the diagnostic, we shed light on the proper analysis of understudied constructions in Santiago Tz'utujil and Mayan more broadly (e.g., nominalizations and Agent Focus clauses). We end by discussing microvariation in the phenomenon across Mayan and within Santiago Tz'utujil, highlighting methodological considerations that arise when we take an I-language approach to investigating a phenomenon of this nature.",1
"In many western Austronesian languages, the fact that an agentive argument lacks full control is morphologically marked on the verb. The formatives used for this purpose are often also found on stative predicates, and it has been suggested that limited-control predicates are stative-like in that they denote the result state of a given eventuality. Here we argue that limited-control predicates differ from both stative and dynamic predicates, and constitute a category of their own. Limited-control marking primarily pertains to agentivity and not to aspectual structure, and, importantly, is only used when control is at issue. With respect to the frequent overlaps with stative morphology, we argue that historically speaking, limited-control and stative marking have a common origin. While the current investigation does not include a full account of the historical developments leading to two synchronically separate categories (stative and limited-control), we provide evidence for the hypothesis that perception predicates had a major role to play in this development.",0

"This chapter provides an overview of directionality relations in allomorphy selection. One type is 'inward-conditioning', where the trigger is in a structurally outer position compared to the target of allomorphy (i.e. it is further away from the lexical head of the construction). This type can also be referred to as 'outward-sensitivity'. Its counterpart is 'outward-conditioning', where it is the trigger which is in an inner position and the target in an outer position (it can also be referred to as 'inward-sensitivity'). A number of typologically diverse cases are presented to illustrate directional asymmetries in allomorphy selection. One robust generalization involves 'grammatically-conditioned allomorphy', in which the trigger is a morphosyntactic feature (e.g. [PLURAL]), feature bundle (e.g. [3.SG.FEM]), or category (e.g. [TENSE]). In this type of allomorphy, both inward-conditioning and outward-conditioning are widespread, showing a clear directional symmetry. In contrast, other types of allomorphy such as 'lexically-conditioned' (the trigger is a particular lexical root), 'morphologically-conditioned' (a purely morphological feature, e.g. conjugation class), and 'phonologically-conditioned allomorphy' show a clear directional asymmetry. Here, allomorph selection almost always involves outward-conditioning, i.e. the trigger is in an inner position. Cases of inward-conditioning are rare and controversial. Taken all together, the propensity for triggers to be inward compared to targets is called the 'directional asymmetry in allomorphy selection'.",0
"This paper presents a corpus-based analysis of voiced velar nasalization (VVN) in
the standard (Yamanote) dialect of Japanese. It is the first quantitative study of the phenomenon, and confirms the impressionistic observation reported in the previous literature; at the same time, our study finds that these generalizations are stochastic. Looking more closely at the determinants of this variation reveals effects of local segmental assimilation, prosodic length, and a strong role of lexical token frequency.",1
"In this paper we introduce the phenomenon of ﬁrst conjunct clitic doubling (FC
CLD). We show that it provides evidence for Agree-based approaches to clitic dou-
bling (CLD) and argues against approaches involving movement. Furthermore, we
explore its implications for theories of the PCC and theories of ﬁrst conjunct agree-
ment (FCA). We show that most theories of the PCC are incompatible with our FC
CLD data because they involve movement in the generation of the clitic/the imple-
mentation of the PCC. Finally, we show that PCC effects with coordination provide
evidence for theories of FCA that are based on rule ordering.",0
"Moro (Kordofanian) is one of few languages which is known to display phonologically-conditioned mobile affixation. As demonstrated by Jenks & Rose (2015), object markers (OM) predictably alternate between suffixal position and prefixal position, depending on several phonological factors, namely, the tone pattern of the stem and the tone of the OM. Jenks & Rose use different cophonologies for the different stem-tone patterns, and they argue that differences in rankings in the different cophonologies are responsible for the limited distribution of affix mobility. In this reply, I show that the crucial ranking difference, obscured by certain constraints employed by Jenks & Rose, involves the relevant morphophonological alignment (Rightmost), not the tonal constraints, as implied by Jenks & Rose. Therefore, while the phonological factor
governing affix mobility in Moro is indeed tone, the factor governing its distribution within the grammar is alignment.",0
"A computational learner needs three things: Data to learn from, a class of representations to acquire, and a way to get from one to the other. Language acquisition is a very particular learning setting that can be defined in terms of the input (the child's early linguistic experience) and the output (a grammar capable of generating a language very similar to the input). The input is infamously impoverished: as it relates to morphology, the vast majority of potential forms are never attested in the input, and those that are attested follow an extremely skewed frequency distribution. Learners nevertheless manage to acquire most details of their native morphologies after only a few years of input. That said, acquisition is not instantaneous nor is it error-free. Children do make mistakes, and they do so in predictable ways which provide insights into their grammars and learning processes. The most elucidating computational model of morphology learning from the perspective of a linguist is one that learns morphology like a child does, that is, on child-like input and along a child-like developmental path. This article focuses on clarifying those aspects of morphology acquisition that should go into such an elucidating computational model. Section 2 describes the input with a focus on child-directed speech corpora and input sparsity. Section 3 discusses representations with focuses on productivity, developmental paths, and formal learnability. Section 4 surveys the range of learning tasks that guide research in computational linguistics and NLP with special focus on how they relate to the acquisition setting. And to conclude, Section 5 presents a summary of morphology acquisition as a learning problem with Table 4 highlighting the key takeaways of this article.",1
"No class of words has better claims to universality than interjections. At the same time, no category has more variable content than this one, traditionally the catch-all basket for linguistic items that bear a complicated relation to sentential syntax. Interjections are a mirror reflecting methodological and theoretical assumptions more than a coherent linguistic category that affords unitary treatment. This chapter focuses on linguistic items that typically function as free-standing utterances, and on some of the conceptual, methodological, and theoretical questions generated by such items. A key move is to study these items in the context of conversational sequences, rather than as a mere sideshow to sentences. This makes visible how some of the most frequent interjections streamline everyday language use and scaffold complex language. Approaching interjections in terms of their sequential positions and interactional functions has the potential to reveal and explain patterns of universality and diversity in interjections.",1
"This paper proposes an analysis of the English auxiliary system
in Hybrid TLG. Our proposal differs from related approaches in
lexicalist syntactic theories (such as HPSG and earlier variants
of categorial grammar) in taking auxiliaries to be higher-order
operators that syntactically (and not just semantically) scope
over the local clauses in which they appear. We formulate an
analysis of the familiar NI(C)E properties of auxiliaries in this
approach. An advantage for the higher-order analysis comes from
the fact that it offers a straightforward solution for a
long-standing puzzle for earlier lexicalist approaches pertaining
to the distribution of the unstressed ""do"".",0
"As codified by Baker's (1985) ""Mirror Principle"" (MP), the linear order of morphemes within a word generally correlates with hierarchical syntactic structure. While Baker uses morphological ordering to demonstrate the inseparability of syntax and morphology, he simply assumes cyclic morphological concatenation as the formal means by which MP-compliance is enacted in the grammar.

This paper develops a new framework for morpheme ordering, the Mirror Alignment Principle (MAP), which derives the MP while avoiding some of the shortcomings of cyclic morphological concatenation. The MAP is a morphology-phonology interface algorithm that takes morphosyntactic c-command relations and dynamically generates a ranking of alignment constraints (McCarthy & Prince 1993) in the phonological component. All possible morpheme orders are considered and evaluated by an Optimality Theoretic (Prince & Smolensky [1993] 2004) phonological grammar, which selects the optimal surface order through constraint interaction. Even though morpheme order is computed in the phonology, the driving force behind this order is the syntax/morphology. This link between grammatical components generates MP-compliant morpheme orders.

This paper focuses on two case studies. First, it will show how the MAP is consistent with the complex interaction between MP-satisfaction and the ""CARP template"" in Bantu (Hyman 2003). Second, it will show that the MAP can explain intricate ordering alternations within Arabic's root-and-pattern verbal system. This will demonstrate that MP-behavior can indeed be identified even in nonconcatenative morphological systems.",0
"Ackerman et al. (2009) and Ackerman and Malouf (2013) argue that the organization of morphological systems allows speakers to efficiently solve the Paradigm Cell Filling Problem: how to predict a word's inflected form given some of its other forms. For example, a given word's possessive suffix in Hungarian can be predicted in part by its phonology and by its exponent in forms like the plural. I propose a model in which this phonological and morphological predictability is encoded in formal, constraint-based grammars. In particular, I extend the sublexicon model (Gouskova et al., 2015), in which lexically specific behavior is handled using diacritics on lexical items. Thus, I treat the Paradigm Cell Filling Problem as a problem of finding correlations between diacritics in a given lexical entry, without relying on the storage of a paradigm's output forms.",0
"This paper examines a constraint on possessor extraction in English. Such
extraction has been observed to be acceptable in the colloquial language of some speakers.
However, this paper shows that extraction of possessive pronouns via topic/focus fronting
is uniquely banned. I argue that this syntactic fact, as well as certain morphological facts
about English possessors, are correctly predicted by the hypothesis that English possessive
pronouns are portmanteau morphemes that correspond to a non-constituent unit in the
underlying syntax. I also argue that this result reveals that phase spell-out simultaneously
subjects entire phases to morpho-phonological evaluation, including phase edges.",0
"We respond to Rodríguez Arrizabalaga's recent claim that Spanish shows genuine cases of strong resultative constructions, e.g., Juan apuñaló a Tomás hasta la muerte 'John stabbed Tom to death', argued to be equivalent to the English construction with the PP to death. This claim is theoretically relevant as it challenges the verb-framed behavior of Spanish with respect to Talmy's typology. Adopting a constructivist view of argument structure, we argue that Spanish hasta la muerte and English to death constructions of this type involve two completely distinct syntactic configurations, and that only the English to death PP can be regarded as a resultative phrase. We claim that the Spanish hasta PP is syntactically computed as an adjunct external to the argument structure of the predicate and provides a bound to the predicate it merges with. We thus show that the Spanish construction with hasta la muerte fully conforms to the class of Talmy's verb-framed languages, in that this type of construction is expected to be fully available and productive in this class of languages.",0
"We argue that Chinese Sign Language (CSL) provides new insights into temporal anaphora, as well as new puzzles. Partee (1973) showed that temporal talk in English involves abstract anaphoric mechanisms akin to pronouns, although with a very different form. Schlenker (2013) argued that in American Sign Language (ASL), one and the same overt pronominal form, the pointing sign, can have individual and temporal uses, but his data involved the same loci across domains: no formal property distinguished temporal from individual anaphora. We replicate ASL temporal anaphora data in CSL, but we also display a new finding: CSL allows for locus establishment and anaphoric pointing on two specifically temporal timelines, a sagittal one (past is backwards) and a vertical one (past is up). Not only can temporal anaphora be overt in CSL; it can also be morphologically distinguished from nominal anaphora (various interesting restrictions on the timelines are also described).",0
"A language possesses a limited set of affixes and of all possible combinations of those affixes only a relatively small number exists, which gives rise to questions about the nature of the restrictions on affix combinability. In the literature, grammatical and extra-grammatical restrictions have been reported. The former refer to the levels of grammar (phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax), the latter involve statistical and/or psycholinguistic information. Phonological restrictions rely on regular phonology. Morphological restrictions use morphological information and, as a rule, produce fixed combinations of two or three affixes. Semantic restrictions are cognitive in nature and refer to scopal relationship and/or compositionality of meaning. Syntactic restrictions are due to mirroring of syntactic derivations. Two types of morphological organization, layered and template morphology, provide the canvas for affix order analyses. Layered morphology operates with hierarchically organized layers and derives morphological structure step-by-step, which implies syntactic ordering and semantic compositionality. Layered morphology may produce variable orders of the same morphemes. Template morphology is flat and the order of affixes in a template is stipulated. Templates derive fixed combinations of affixes and are incompatible with variation. Although a clear distinction between layered and template morphology is made at a theoretical level, there is hardly a language that falls under only one of the two types. All grammatical restrictions on affix ordering are compatible with both layered and template morphology and no language's affixation system can be explained with a single affix ordering principle. As regards the length of the sequences of affixes inspected in different studies, affix order analyses are usually based on combinations of two and three affixes. Bigrams and trigrams also appear to be the most appropriate sequences for learning of affix ordering patterns both by humans and machines.",0
"This chapter investigates the relationship between prefixed verbs and related zero nominalizations in Czech. Specifically, we focus on the fact that the prefix in zero-derived nominalizations often has a different form compared to the one found in the related verb. Our goal is to understand why this is so, i.e., why the shape of the prefix changes when we derive a noun from the verb (or vice versa). Our analysis relies on the wide-spread idea that zero nominalizations share with verbs a number of functional projections, but their structure is impoverished. The most relevant property that zero nominalizations lack is aspect. Since prefixes are crucially involved in aspectual interpretation, the absence of aspect in nouns triggers a special shape of the prefix. The specific implementation draws on the Nanosyntax theory of spellout (Starke 2018, De Clercq 2019). We also rely on the idea that the prefix undergoes phrasal movement, as proposed in Svenonius (2004).",0
"So-called linking elements may actually fulfil two very different roles: they may be phonotactic elements or they may realize a morphosyntactic head. I present a case study of linking elements in Dutch which do fulfil a morphosyntactic role. I note first that when 'linking elements' are of this type, the linguist should be aware of the fact that they may be null morphemes. I show that, indeed, Dutch may have such a null affix in its inventory. I then argue that the Dutch linking elements are in fact noun class markers and as such, I derive the fact that two of them are identical to plural marking through cumulative exponence. I point out that these noun classes co-exist with gender marking and may cause so-called erroneous reference. The analysis shows that a careful study of such elements provides us with new insights into two domains simultaneously. Firstly, we learn more about the morphosyntax of the compound's left-hand part, the structure of the compound itself and the inventory of compounding types in the language. The importance of the left-hand part cannot be underestimated in my opinion. It is a unique domain: it shows how a category behaves functionally in the absence of functional material that guarantees reference, such as number and the D-layer. As such, we learn, secondly, something about the morphosyntax of a category. In this contribution it appears that the Dutch nominal domain has nominal classes which are less visible in the nominal group as they are syncretic with number marking. Take away number marking and they become visible.",0
"Morphological movement arises as an automatic consequence of the Merge-based approach to morphological exponence in harmonic serialism developed in Mueller (2020), where competing outputs can be separated from the input by at most one operation: If a second-merged exponent obeys a lower-ranked competing alignment constraint, the derivation cannot respond by squeezing it in between the stem and the first-merged exponent, because of the Strict Cycle Condition, and consequently a new alignment constraint violation is triggered that is undone by movement in the following step. This gives rise to a new approach to seemingly non-local phonological processes in words, which can now be analyzed as local reflexes of  movement in the exponent's base position. We illustrate this with case studies of verb inflection in Homshetsma Armenian and diminutive formation in European and Brazilian Portuguese, thereby extending the approach in Gleim et al. (2021) to further phenomena.",0
"[New title, June 2021: The lexical core of a complex functional affix: Russian baby-diminutive -onok] 

Like other syntactic elements, affixes are sometimes said to be heads or modifiers. In Russian, one suffix,-onok, can be either: as a head, it is a size diminutive denoting baby animals, and as a modifier, it is an evaluative with a dismissive/affectionate flavor. Various grammatical properties of this suffix differ between the two uses: gender, declension class, and interaction with suppletive alternations, both as target and trigger. We explore a reductionist account of these differences: the baby diminutive comprises a lexical morpheme plus a functional nominalizing head, while the evaluative affix is the lexical morpheme alone. We contend that our account is superior to two conceivable alternatives: first, the view that these are homophonous but unrelated affixes, and second, a cartographic alternative, whereby diminutives attach at different levels in a universal structure.",0
"This paper reports briefly on the prosodic structure of the verbal complex in Blackfoot (Algonquian; Frantz 2017) as described in Weber (2020, 2021), and outlines an explicit methodology for determining morphemic and prosodic analyses of Algonquian languages. I argue that the verbal complex in Blackfoot contains a smaller phonological domain corresponding to the stem, similar to other Algonquian languages. In other ways, Blackfoot prosodic structure diverges from other languages. Preverbs do not have the same generalizations as independent words, and instead adjoin to the smaller phonological domain. A brief comparison with Plains Cree shows that preverbs do not have a uniform prosody across the language, indicating a need for a familywide comparison of prosody.

"Sorani Kurdish, also known as Central Kurdish, has a complex morphology, particularly due to the patterns in which morphemes appear. Although several aspects of Kurdish morphology have been studied, such as pronominal endoclitics and Izafa constructions, Sorani Kurdish morphology has received trivial attention in computational linguistics. Moreover, some morphemes, such as the emphasis endoclitic =îş, and derivational morphemes have not been previously studied. To tackle the complex morphology of Sorani, we provide a thorough description of Sorani Kurdish morphological and morphophonological constructions in a formal way such that they can be used as finite-state transducers for morphological analysis and synthesis.",0
"Middle-passive constructions in Asturian –a Romance language spoken in the diglossic region of Asturias, in northern Spain– appear to optionally allow the occurrence of the reflexive pronoun se in them (esti pan esmigáya(se) fácil; 'this bread crumbles easily'); this has been traditionally considered a pleonastic use of the reflexive due to the influence of Spanish, i.e. the dominant language in the territory (ALLA 2001). Here, I claim that the presence of such pronoun is not optional; instead, I argue that this clitic spells out a passive Voice head encoding the participation of an implicit generic agent/experiencer in the event, giving rise to a generic se-passive configuration. The se-less counterpart, on the contrary, is only possible with unaccusative verbs and those undergoing the causative alternation, thus resulting in a generic inchoative configuration. Among the evidence I present supporting this claim is the fact that only the reflexive variant can control into a purpose clause, but it does not license the insertion of the PP por sí mesmu ('by itself'); this is quite the opposite of what happens with the se-less counterpart. Additionally, I explain that the presence/absence of the reflexive in middle contexts in Asturian and Asturian Spanish may be subject to crosslinguistic influence; therefore, several cases of linguistic transfer between Asturian and Asturian Spanish are teased apart and discussed.",0
"Based on data from number agreement in the four Kartvelian languages (Georgian, Laz, Megrelian, Svan), this paper argues that Vocabulary Insertion is only partially replacive: the exponent replaces only those features of the head which its specification matches exactly, whereas the remaining unlexicalized features-what we call leftover features-remain syntactically active. Our evidence comes from the fact that in Kartvelian languages the choice of the exponent for a lower agreement head can feed or bleed number agreement with a higher agreement head, depending on whether this exponent lexicalizes a plural feature. We argue that the cases of feeding arise from Leftover Agreement-agreement of a higher head with the number features on the lower head which were not lexicalized by its exponent-and we provide additional evidence from an intervention effect in Svan and a locality effect in Georgian for the syntactic nature of this process. An implication of our proposal is that grammar allows for a certain kind of interleaving of syntax and spell-out, where accessibility of the uninterpretable features on edges of phases (on their heads and specifiers) is dependent on whether or not they have been lexicalized within the phase.",0
"We provide an overview and synthesis of grammatical approaches to blocking effects: informally, cases in which the ungrammaticality of one word (or phrase) is attributed to the existence of another. Our primary focus concerns the scope of competition for grammaticality. While discussions of blocking are often directed at particular parts of the grammar-- e.g. derivational morphology-- the larger set of questions raised by (putative) blocking effects has the potential to distinguish predictions made by  major theoretical movements like the Minimalist Program and Optimality Theory, precisely because of the different roles they attribute to  competition. Our review  of  theories of blocking is oriented towards larger questions of this type. As part of our review, we also examine the apparent absence of blocking; cases in which it looks as if one form should (all else equal) block another, yet both exist. Observations to this effect appear in  early and influential accounts of blocking, where they have  underappreciated theoretical consequences concerning how the `paradigm space' associated with words and phrases is structured. A key theme throughout the paper is whether the phenomena that have been described as blocking effects are derivative of one grammatical (or extra-grammatical) mechanism, or several. While our review concludes that the latter view is correct, part of our argument is that the focus on unity is less important than the question of what evidence for (or against) competition in a given domain would look like in the first place.",0
"This paper investigates the phenomenon of additive plural morphology being used to mark the associative plural in a variety of languages. A novel empirical generalization is proposed: Languages with identical additive and associative plural morphology lack free-standing definite articles. This follows a line of generalizations made by Boskovic (2008b, 2012), who argue that languages without free-standing definite articles do not project the DP layer. I propose a new analysis of associative plurals that deduces the empirical generalization. I argue that Num, the position of additive plural morphology, moves to the head of an Associative Phrase, a projection above DP. This movement operation is blocked by the DP phase in free-standing definite article languages.",0
"This paper investigates the principles that govern subject marking in Awing (Grassfields Bantu). We observe that the subject marker (SM) that doubles the subject is sometimes obligatory, sometimes optional and sometimes prohibited. We argue that it is the referentiality of the subject that controls the distribution of the SM in Awing, rather than factors such as its morpho-syntactic features or its information structural status, which have been identified to govern argument doubling in a number of other languages with a similar phenomenon. The empirical evidence leads us to conclude that the SM is a pronominal element in Awing rather  than an agreement marker. When it occurs, it functions as the argument of the verb and the associated subject NP is base-generated in the left periphery of the clause; when it is absent, the NP is the verbal argument. Awing thus qualifies as a pronominal argument language in the sense of Jelinek (1984), Bresnan and Mchombo (1987), and Baker (1996).",1
"Asante Twi (AT), a Kwa language spoken mainly in Ghana, exhibits an asymmetry in
whether a focus-fronted constituent leaves a gap or a resumptive pronoun (RP) in its base position. It has been argued that this asymmetry is linked to the category of the extracted constituent (Korsah and Murphy 2020) such that constituents with a nominal [+N] core leave an RP while those with a non-nominal [–N] core leave a gap. In this paper, based on elicitation data from five native speakers, however, we observe that the [±N]-status of the extractee is not decisive. The data show that focus-fronting of some nominals obligatorily results in a gap in the base position, too. The relevant nominals are parts of idioms, predicative nouns, and non-specific indefinite bare nouns. What unites those nominals is that they form a subset of what is often termed non- or less referential nouns. The crucial factor in determining a gap or an RP thus seems to be a semantic/pragmatic one. As the relevant noun types do not match up entirely with the set of non-referential expressions, we propose to model the apparent influence of semantic properties as stemming from a structural difference between the two types of nominals. The nominals that leave an RP contain a D-layer, whereas the ones that leave a gap lack it. Given that (resumptive) pronouns are D-heads (Postal 1969, Abney 1987, Elbourne 2001) we suggest that partial deletion of the NP-part of the lowest copy in a focus movement chain is what creates a stranded D-head to be realized as an RP. For nominals that lack a D-layer independently, the result of partial deletion is the same as that of full copy deletion, namely a gap. Asante Twi thus exhibits
a preference of RPs over gaps where possible, a pattern that is in conflict with economy constraints such as Avoid Pronoun (Chomsky 1981, Montalbetti 1984).",0
"Eisenberg (2021, FAZ) raises concerns a construction used to make language gender-inclusive  in German, the so-called 'gender gap'. This study specifically addresses claims pertaining whether this construction is compatible with German Grammar. Eisenberg claims (i) that forms encoded with the gender gap are unambiguously feminine, and hence not in fact inclusive; (ii) realizing the gap before '-in' with a glottal stop, as is sometimes reported or even recommended, causes stress to shift to the suffix, but neither stress nor glottal stop on a suffix are compatible with German morphophonology. We report on two preregistered production experiments that compare Eisenberg's analysis with an alternative, according to which gender gaps are shorthands for larger coordinate structures (e.g., Stefanowitsch 2018, Blogpost). More specifically, we propose that gender gaps involve ellipsis and (asyndetic) coordination. Forms like 'Leser*in' are understood to stand in for 'Leser/Leserin', which in turn are interpreted as coordinations (either existentially as 'or' or universally as 'and'). The stress and the glottal stop on the suffix are due to a general phonological constraint on conjuncts, which must be at least prosodic-word-sized (Booij 1985). This predicts that gender gaps should show determiner-matching effects parallel to asyndetic and syndetic coordinations.",0
"This is a reply to an article by Peter Eisenberg („Unter dem Muff von hundert Jahren""), which appeared in the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung on January 8 2021. In the article, Eisenberg argues that the German ‚gender gap' is meaningless, and that its pronunciation with a glottal stop violates basic principles of German grammar. The reply argues that contrary to Eisenberg's claims, the gender gap is in fact in tune with German grammar, and that its pronunciation, including the likely occurrance of a glottal stop, is a natural consequence of its underlying grammar. 

The title of the reply (‚Leute lasst es knacken') is colloquial, and roughly means ‚Get cracking.' But it evokes other meanings: The glottal stop, which plays a role in the article, is called ‚crack-sound' („Knacklaut"") in German. ‚Lass es knacken' could be understood as an encouragment to use a gender gap along with a glottal stop. But it can also be understood as an encouragement to allow others to do so. 

The reply is written in the style of a newspaper article, and does not contain footnotes etc., as they would be expected if this was a contribution to an academic journal. I have recently presented the research mentioned in the article that shows evidence for the proposed coordination analysis of the gender gap at a Psycholinguistics conference (AMLaP Paris, September 2021).",0
"In Santiago Laxopa Zapotec, associated motion prefixes apply to a verbal base to introduce a preceding motion event with the verb's external argument as the mover. In this paper, I argue that the semantic composition of such complex events is best understood within a broader typology of how heads can introduce new thematic information. In particular, I advance a proposal featuring elements of event chaining akin to causative constructions, together with argument identification akin to restructuring verbs that take subject­less prejacents. In addition to explaining the features of associated motion in this language, the account offers some insight on patterns observed in the general typology of associated motion.",0
"This paper takes two challenging characteristics of the Turkish case system and shows that a nanosyntactic analysis can cover both. The first puzzle is that some cases, namely ACC and GEN, in Turkish show alternations between specific and non-specific forms, while other cases like DAT and INS do not. The second puzzle concerns containment relations in morphology. Caha (2009) proposes that cases stand in a containment relation. In some languages like Estonian, Tocharian, and Vlax Romani, the ACC form serves as the foundation of the oblique cases. The puzzle is that in Turkish, the morphological containment holds only for ACC and GEN, but not for ACC and the other obliques. The comparison leads us to expect that the INS in Turkish could be *adam-ı-la, with the ACC marker to the left of -la. Interestingly, this expectation fails precisely in those cases which do not distinguish specific and non-specific forms. We propose a solution to both of these puzzles within the Nanosyntactic framework. The main idea is that Turkish nouns and cases can be composed of smaller, sub-morphemic features. These features allow specificity information to be encapsulated within the noun itself, rather than the case as previously suggested by Öztürk (2005).",0
"This paper argues that training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on local and non-local dependencies in speech data offers insights into how deep neural networks discretize continuous data and how symbolic-like rule-based morphophonological processes emerge in a deep convolutional architecture. Acquisition of speech has recently been modeled as a dependency between latent space and data generated by GANs in Beguš (2020b), who models learning of a simple local allophonic distribution. We extend this approach to test learning of local and nonlocal phonological processes that include approximations of morphological processes. We further parallel outputs of the model to results of a behavioral experiment where human subjects are trained on the data used for training the GAN network. Four main conclusions emerge: (i) the networks provide useful information for computational models of speech acquisition even if trained on a comparatively small dataset of an artificial grammar learning experiment; (ii) local processes are easier to learn than non-local processes, which matches both behavioral data in human subjects and typology in the world's languages. This paper also proposes (iii) how we can actively observe the network's progress in learning and explore the effect of training steps on learning representations by keeping latent space constant across different training steps. Finally, this paper shows that (iv) the network learns to encode the presence of a prefix with a single latent variable; by interpolating this variable, we can actively observe the operation of a non-local phonological process. The proposed technique for retrieving learning representations has general implications for our understanding of how GANs discretize continuous speech data and suggests that rule-like generalizations in the training data are represented as an interaction between variables in the network's latent space.",0
"This thesis offers a new account of a persisting puzzle in the theory of ellipsis and association with focus: the fact that phi-featural content in full DPs and on bound pronouns can sometimes be ignored in focus alternatives and in calculating identity for ellipsis ('Fake Features'). I present new data about gender and number mismatch in ellipsis which proves difficult to model on existing approaches to fake features. The heart of the proposal is a derivational theory of contentful phi-features: they do not, as usually assumed, enter a derivation from the lexicon with listed meanings (presuppositions) that constrain the denotation of their host DP; rather, they are inserted late in the derivation towards PF by a process called ""Valuation from Context"": the features are inserted based on the meaning of the DP in the (local or global) context of evaluation. Ellipsis identity and focus alternatives are computed off of the feature-less representation. The theory assumes that the construction of local contexts for embedded constituents (Schlenker 2009) is blind to information encoded in focus alternatives. The account supports an architecture of grammar in which representations that are submitted to semantic interpretation (meaning-in-context) feed morphological
valuation processes. It also implies that there is no substantial difference between ""interpreted"" and ""uninterpreted"" phi-features; in a sense, both are uninterpreted, the distinction being whether they are valued from context or from pieces in the structure.",0
"This paper is a response to eight commentaries (for Theoretical Linguistics) on my target paper ""General linguistics must be based on universals (or nonconventional aspects of language)"" by David Adger, Balthasar Bickel, Roberta D'Alessandro, Diana Forker, José-Luis Mendívil-Giró, Susanne Fuchs & Ludger Paschen, Adam Tallman, and Dietmar Zaefferer.",0
"This paper highlights the importance of the distinction between general linguistics (the study of Human Language) and particular linguistics (the study of individual languages), which is often neglected. The term ""theoretical linguistics"" is often used as if it entailed general claims. But I note that (unless one studies nonconventional aspects of language, e.g. reaction times as in psycholinguistics), one must study universals if one wants to make general claims. These universals can be of the Greenbergian type, based on grammatical descriptions of the speaker's social conventions, or they can be based on the natural-kinds programme, where linguists try to describe mental grammars as made up of universal building blocks of an innate grammar blueprint. The natural-kinds programme is incompatible with Chomsky's claims about Darwin's Problem, but it is indispensable for a general linguistics in the generative tradition. The Greenbergian programme, by contrast, can make use of framework-free descriptions because its comparisons are based on independently defined universal yardsticks.",0
"Theories of the phonology-morphology interface can be differentiated by their claims regarding the timing of phonologically conditioned suppletive allomorphy (PCSA) and regular phonology. Some (e.g. Paster 2006, Embick 2010) argue that PCSA occurs in a morphological component of the grammar that precedes phonology; others (e.g. Kager 1996, Mascaró 2007, Smith 2015) argue that at least phonologically optimizing PCSA occurs in the phonological component of the grammar, with regular phonology. This paper discusses a case of apparently optimizing PCSA in Yindjibarndi (Pama-Nyungan, Wordick 1982), proposes an analysis in which suppletive allomorphy precedes regular phonology, and shows that the alternative – an analysis in which PCSA occurs in the phonological component of the grammar – should be dispreferred.",0
"PF-deletion accounts of ellipsis currently enjoy popularity in the mainstream generative framework. These approaches assume that elided material has full syntactic representation. Since ellipsis clearly impacts the actual phonetic realization of a sentence, the lack of pronunciation in ellipsis is understood in these accounts as some kind of silencing of the syntactic structure, which takes place at PF. While this much is agreed on, there is no consensus yet within PF-deletion theories on the question of what operation (or lack thereof) in the derivation of the syntactic and/or the PF presentation causes the silencing. This chapter summarizes and highlights the attempts that have been made to determine when ellipsis applies in the grammar. By bringing together different views on the topic, we hope to pave the way towards a better understanding of the nature of ellipsis itself in silent structure theories.",0
"[revised & extended version] Passive is customarily defined with reference to a verb and relational changes in the syntactic realization of its argument structure. However, this is too narrow a perspective. Passive may be applied not only to single verbs but also to verbal clusters. In this case, the passivized verb is the top-most verb in the cluster but the donor verb of the passive subject is a dependent one. The basic grammatical mechanism remains the same, but the argument structure it operates on in different. In the case of verbal clusters, the argument structure of the cluster is the aggregate of the argument structures of the verbs in the cluster. 

Four such cases are analysed, namely the passive of Ecm-constructions (a.k.a. AcI) headed by ""lassen"" (let) or by a perception verb, the passivization of passive, namely the additional passivization of German get-passives, and the passive of German clause-union infinitivals, a.k.a. long-distance passive.
In all these four cases, and in the case of simple verbs, the grammatical means of achieving the passive effect are identical, namely a combination of a participial form with a (semi)-auxiliary. The participle blocks the argument that surfaces as subject in the active construction. In verbal clusters, passive operates on the aggregated argument structure of the cluster, whose existence is independently motivated and necessary for the management of the aggregated argument structure of the clustered verbs. Passive applies to this argument structure in the same manner as it applies to the argument structure of a simple verb.",0
"An individual's variation in writing style is often a function of both social and personal attributes. While structured social variation has been extensively studied, e.g., gender based variation, far less is known about how to characterize individual styles due to their idiosyncratic nature. We introduce a new approach to studying idiolects through a massive cross-author comparison to identify and encode stylistic features. The neural model achieves strong performance at authorship identification on short texts and through an analogy-based probing task, showing that the learned representations exhibit surprising regularities that encode qualitative and quantitative shifts of idiolectal styles. Through text perturbation, we quantify the relative contributions of different linguistic elements to idiolectal variation. Furthermore, we provide a description of idiolects through measuring inter- and intra-author variation, showing that variation in idiolects is often distinctive yet consistent.",0
"This book manuscript argues that adjectival inflections and ein 'a' in German are semantically vacuous. It is argued that these two types of elements have at least three things in common: (a) they are expletive elements, (b) they make certain nominal features visible, and (c) they indicate different sizes of nominal structure with inflections performing this task in the higher layers of the DP and ein in the lower layers. There are two main differences: (i) different types of adjectival inflections (weak vs. strong) indicate nominal structures involving different degrees of embedding of adjectives in simple vs. complex DPs; (ii) ein supports overt semantic operators (e.g., k = NEG as in kein 'no') and ""flags"" the presence of covert semantic operators (e.g., TYPE).

This manuscript dates back to August 2012. It has already been cited and I would like to make it more easily accessible. Comments are welcome. I hope to finalize this book in the near future.",0
"Human language processing is incremental. In this dissertation, I explore how an incremental perspective can help us clarify our understanding of transformational syntax, which typically proceeds bottom-up. As part of our exploration, I develop an incremental head-driven parsing algorithm for Minimalist Grammars. The two main innovations of this parsing algorithm are the formulation of a left-corner-like transformation for feature sequences of linguistic expressions, and the treatment of syntactic movement by inverting movement chains.

When viewed from the perspective of incremental parsing, some aspects of syntax become simpler: movement turns out to always be 'covert': the phonological form of a lexical item is processed when it is encountered in the input, but its meaning may get moved around in the derivation and the resulting logical form. 
In addition to the standard Minimalist Grammar operations Merge and Move, I also discuss adjunction and coordinate structures. Adjunction is reduced to Merge with the help of an Adjunctivizer head, which takes the phrase adjoined to as its complement and projects the same category that it selects. I also discuss the distinction between A-movement and A-bar-movement, arguing that A-bar-movement is in some sense optional and that the licensing features for A-bar-movement are not part of specific lexical items, but are instead introduced by functional heads. 

I then sketch a compositional semantics that follows the incremental syntactic derivation: instead of being type driven, semantic composition will be driven by syntax, such that every syntactic Merge or Move operation corresponds to semantic Function Application with the syntactically selecting element uniformly acting as the function and the selected element as its semantic argument. 
Turning to the semantics of movement, I argue that an A-bar-moved expression makes separate meaning contributions at the top and at the base of a movement chain. The meaning contribution at the base of the chain is the core meaning of the moved item, while the meaning discharged at the top of the chain is provided by the head, which also introduces the licensing feature. So A-bar-movement always reconstructs, except when the moved element is a quantificational determiner phrase, which can take scope via Quantifier Raising licensed by a scope feature. 

Finally, I use the proposed incremental syntax and semantics to argue that syntactic islands should not be viewed as a constraints within syntax. Instead different island effects may have different non-syntactic explanations. I first argue that specifiers are islands because of incremental structure building. Second, I offer an explanation of weak islands: I argue that weak island effects are identical to (focus) intervention effects, and that movement chains introduced by a Q head cannot span across (focus) interveners. But movement licensed by the scope feature of determiner phrases is not affected by intervention effects and can thus span across weak island interveners.",0
"The Celtic languages are characterized by an elaborate system of alternations of word-initial segments, traditionally known as 'consonant mutations'. Although historically they arose from across-the-board phonological sandhi, they are now deeply embedded in morphosyntactic processes. They are relatively phonologically coherent, but also non-concatenative, and sensitive to a wide range of lexical, morphological, syntactic, and semantic factors. As a result, Celtic mutations present an important test bed for theories of word structure and its interactions with both phonology and morphology. This chapter describes the principal mutation patterns across the Celtic languages, and aims to pinpoint those questions that are of particular importance for theoretical progress.",0
"This article shows that resultative constructions and small clause constructions are structurally parallel to each other. On the one hand, drawing mainly on data from Mandarin Chinese, it argues for a small clause analysis of resultatives. On the other hand, building on the previous work by the constructivist approach, it proposes that the verbal roots involved in both resultatives and small clause
constructions should be treated as event modifiers. The two constructions should involve the same basic syntactic structure in narrow syntax. Their different configurational meanings or event structures are attributed to their different compositional semantics at the C-I interface. For instance, the little v can be
interpreted differently at the interface, although no different ""flavors"" of it are posited in narrow syntax. The conclusions achieved in this article instantiates the idea developed in Marantz (2013) and Wood and Marantz (2017) that syntax is autonomous from semantics: the same syntactic structure might express
different meanings.",0
"The relation between auxiliaries and argumental properties of the lexical verbs is the question raised by the facts we will investigate. Other issues are posed by the role and the behavior of deictic clitic pronouns in different contexts and in the clitic string. The data examined in this contribution come mainly from the Franco-Provençal dialects spoken in the villages of Celle San Vito and Faeto in North Apulia; these dialects are the heritage linguistic use of ancient minorities dating back to the thirteenth century. We will briefly compare these data with the related data of the Franco-Provençal varieties of West Piedmont. The analysis we propose relies on the idea that auxiliary verbs are not functional elements but preserve their lexical properties, as shown by the identic syntactic behavior of be in its different occurrences. The theoretical frame we follow is the formulation proposed in Chomsky (2020a,b), based on the merge operation and the Labeling Algorithm, leading to a more appropriate treatment of 'head movement' and agreeing syntactic structures.",0
"Africanisms in Diasporic languages are important markers of cultural continuity and cultural resistance in the Transatlantic Holocaust. While research of Africanisms in the languages of the United States southeast seacoast, South/Central America, and the Caribbean is extensive, there is little preexisting research on veritable lexical Africanisms in the language of the Native Black American population of the United States mainland (extramural to the southeast seacoast and Louisiana) – as lexical Africanisms among this particular segment of the Native Black American population of the United States are generally thought to be negligible, if not non-existent. However, in this study, I will demonstrate that the language spoken by this segment of the Native Black American population is, in fact, endowed with a great many Africanisms of Fulfulde/Pulaar origin. By providing an analysis of the complex meanings of lexical items as attested by Native Black American informants and comparing these lexical items with 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century texts of the Fulfulde/Pulaar language – with a particular focus on the source language's complex system of radicals/root-stems and affixes – I will demonstrate that there is, in fact, a prodigious body of veritable Fulfulde-/Pulaar-derived words and phrases existing in the language of the Native Black American population of the United States mainland that negates the myth of African lexical scarcity in the language of Native Black Americans and connotes cultural continuity and cultural resistance.",0
"Numerical cognition is an essential component of our daily life. It is the ability to process numerical quantities. In language, symbolic representations of numerical quantities are encoded by numerals. In situations of language contact, numerals are often borrowed from one language into another (Haspelmath & Tadmor 2009), and it has been observed that high and more abstract numerals are more prone to borrowing than lower numerals (Matras 2009: 202). Linguists mainly explain the higher borrowability of high numerals in sociocultural terms, for example, because of ""their association with formal contexts of use"" and ""through intensification of economic activity"" (Matras 2009: 200). We propose an alternative explanation, informed by cognitive science, showing that low numerals are more resistant to borrowing than high numerals because they are more deeply anchored in cognition.",0
"This chapter presents a study of stress uniformity in the polysynthetic language Ese Ejja. In minimally inflected words, inflectional suffixes assign accent to the stem, which is then mapped to primary stress. The accent-to-stress algorithm results in an 'opposite-to-anchor' system: accent is anchored to the triggering suffix at the right edge, but the location of primary stress appears at the left edge. Ese Ejja conspicuously suspends accent-to-stress mapping in more complex words, such as verbs with derivational morphology. Instead, in such contexts a kind of 'stress uniformity' is employed whereby complex forms copy the stress from an equivalent simplex form, e.g. [ROOT-INFL]x → [ROOT-DERIV-INFL]x, where x = identical stress. This chapter relates these aspects of Ese Ejja stress to the rarity of opposite-to-anchor systems generally (such as 'count systems'), and the general bias in stress systems for default-to-same-edge properties.",0
"[To appear in Glossa titled ""Case-sensitive
plural suppletion in Barguzin Buryat: On case containment, suppletion
typology, and competition in morphology"".]

This paper examines plural suppletion in Barguzin Buryat (Mongolic, Russia), which
occurs only in accusative and genitive noun phrases. The restricted distribution of this process,
in particular its impossibility in oblique cases, is significant for recent research on the typology
of suppletion and the feature structure of case. For much work in this vein, this plural suppletion
would qualify as an ""ABA"" pattern, which is predicted to be unattested. I argue that the suppletive
plural morpheme in Barguzin Buryat is a portmanteau, which superficially has an ABA distribution
because it conflicts, for independent reasons, with the morphological requirements of oblique cases.
Since the distribution of this plural form is reducible to independent factors, it does not falsify the
morphological theories that ban ABA patterns under normal circumstances, but rather reveals a
principled exception to them that sharpens our understanding of them.",0
"Inverse case attraction (ICA) is a phenomenon where the head of a seemingly externally-headed relative clause is marked with the case assigned to the gap inside the relative clause, rather than the case assigned to the position that the entire modified noun phrase appears in. This paper presents an analysis of ICA based primarily on novel fieldwork data from Koryak, a highly endangered Chukotko-Kamchatkan language of the Russian Far East.  The paper argues that Koryak relative clauses with inverse case attraction are actually surface-internally-headed, but their heads appear in the embedded left periphery, thereby instantiating a type of relative clause that has so far been argued to exist only in the Gur languages of West Africa. I show that there are syntactic parallels between Gur relative clauses and Koryak ICA, despite the fact that Gur languages have no morphological case marking. An important consequence of the relative clause being surface-internally-headed is that it becomes unsurprising that the head should be assigned its case inside the relative clause. This derives the unexpected case pattern in ICA while dispensing with case attraction as a morphosyntactic primitive. Implications for the raising analysis of relative clauses are also discussed. A survey of other languages with inverse case attraction suggests that internally-headed relative clauses with left-peripheral heads are likely to be a general solution to ICA across languages.",0
"A description of the Nanosyntax framework (Starke 2009, 2018) written as a chapter for a volume on minimalism, edited by Kleanthes Grohmann and Evelina Leivada. I mainly focus on the differences concerning the role of the lexicon in the grammar in Nanosyntax vs. standard minimalism.",0
"The complexity of linguistic patterns has been an object of extensive debate in research programs focused on probing the inherent structure of human language abilities. But in what sense is a linguistic phenomenon more complex than another, and what can complexity tell us about the connection between linguistic typology and human cognition? This chapter approaches these questions by presenting a broad and informal introduction to the vast literature on formal language theory, computational learning theory, and artificial grammar learning.
In doing so, it hopes to provide readers with an understanding of the relevance of mathematically grounded approaches to cognitive investigations into linguistic complexity, and thus further fruitful collaborations between cognitive scientists and mathematically inclined linguists and psychologists.",0
"This article deals with three semiotic concepts, i.e. semiosphere, boundary and poetic text, introduced by Lotman (1976, 1990, 2005) to interpret two poetic texts written by Shakti Chattopadhyay, an eminent modern Bengali poet. I also deploy the conventional method of metrical scansion of Bengali prosodic structure and address the irregularities by deep reading of the said texts. The result of such deep reading leads us to some significant semiotic moves that coordinate the readers with the poet. The structural interpretation also includes prosodic irregularities compared with the regular prosodic patterns.",0
"Standard accounts of declension classes often rely on postulating arbitrary declension-class features. The problem with this is that then our grammar operates over language-specific features, which creates a tension with a restrictive theory of UG based on a universal set of features relevant for language. This article shows how declension classes can be modeled without using language-specific declension features. The new version contains an analysis of the plural declension, which is absent in the version published in Acta Linguistica Academica for reasons of space.",0
"The terms ""deponency"" and ""deponents"" originally referred to a particular class of Latin verbs which take passive (""nonactive"") morphology but are syntactically active. The term has subsequently been extended to cover verbs in other languages with seemingly aberrant voice morphology, and eventually to describe other kinds of perceived mismatches between morphology and syntax. Deponency has therefore become a useful tool for testing and comparing the predictions and assumptions made by different morphological theories, specifically regarding the lexicon-(morpho)syntax interface. However, the different definitions of and theoretical approaches to deponency found in the literature render it difficult to evaluate and compare specific theoretical claims. Definitions that are too broad do not capture a natural class of phenomena, while definitions that are too narrow or explicitly tailored to a specific language obscure potentially valuable cross-linguistic generalizations. Theoretical approaches moreover differ in whether they treat deponency as a property of a designated morphological domain, a purely lexical (diachronically motivated) idiosyncrasy, or an interaction of different synchronic factors. This article uses deponency in Latin as a case study of these issues and discusses the behavior of Latin deponents in finite and non-finite contexts, in primary and secondary verbs, and from various theoretical perspectives. It is shown that the perceived mismatch of deponent verbs in Latin arises from a discrepancy between argument structure and voice morphology in a lexically specified subset of morphologically nonactive/""passive"" verbs which unexpectedly have an agent subject, while the vast majority of verbs with this morphology actually displays canonical behavior with respect to argument structure and voice morphology. Future work on deponency in Latin and other languages that display form-function mismatches must therefore disentangle the lexically specific aspects of these phenomena from properties that follow from general morphological or syntactic principles of the language(s) under study.",0
"The inflection of Algonquian transitive verbs includes an agreement suffix known as the ""central ending"". The patterning of this suffix can ordinarily be described without reference to syntactic roles: the central ending indexes either (i) both arguments simultaneously or (ii) the argument with more richly specified phi-features. In certain contexts, however, the central ending instead appears to show a preference for indexing the subject, even when the subject's features are clearly less specified than those of the object. This exceptional subject preference is surprising to observe in an agreement slot that is otherwise conditioned purely by feature hierarchies rather than syntactic roles.

In this squib I argue that the exceptional subject preference is only apparent. Rather than a preference to index the subject, there is a more general preference to maximize the informational value of the agreement morphology by not redundantly repeating exactly the same information in two agreement slots. In certain contexts, this pressure has driven the central ending to index the subject even though the subject's features are less specified than those of the object, simply because the object's features have already been fully identified in a separate agreement slot. This process, which can be formalized as an impoverishment rule, creates the illusion of a preference to index the subject, but in fact the only preference is to make the agreement morphology as informative as possible. The lesson that emerges is that the possibility of describing a morphological pattern in syntactic terms does not guarantee that the correct explanation for the pattern actually lies in the syntax. Morphological factors can conspire to create patterns that deceptively appear to have a syntactic source.",0
"This paper presents a novel analysis of the stress system of Ichishkiin Sɨnwit (Sahaptian). Ichishkiin Sɨnwithas been previously analyzed as a unique example of a stress system requiring a ranking of the AffixFaithfulness constraints over the Root Faithfulness constraints. I argue, however, that such idiosyncratic stress mechanisms are not necessary. Instead, I propose that accent assignment is cyclic: Underlying accent in the outermost derivational layer within the relevant domain wins. A central role in this analysis belongs to (i) the underlying specification of morphemes for accent, and to (ii) morpho-prosodic domains. The current proposal additionally offers an insight into the role of morpho-prosodic domains in the hiatus resolution strategies.",1
"This review surveys the phonological asymmetries between roots and non-roots (affixes, clitics). It starts with an extraphonological, structural definition of roots, and considers those non-phonological properties that are phonologically relevant: they are easily borrowed, and they are most deeply embedded. The empirical portion of the review concentrates on templaticism and size restrictions, asymmetries in segmental contrast/inventories, the properties of multi-root words (compounds), and accentual characteristics that differ between roots and affixes. The theoretical section surveys theories that account for these properties: Prosodic Morphology, Positional Faithfulness, the cycle and its analogs, and
Anti-Faithfulness. I then critically review several recent and not-so-recent proposals that blur the line between affixes and roots, using the 'root' designation diacritically or recasting diacritic distinctions as structural distinctions. The concluding section discusses the role of roots in phonological learnability.",0
"We present new data in support of the proposal that, in order to formally license English VP ellipsis, a functional head T must receive a value for its inflection (INFL) specification and have a valued Tense (Tns) feature. Put in different terms, we argue that, to license VP ellipsis, T must enter into a Spec-Head agreement relationship with the phrase in its specifier, and must be in a c-command relationship with a local v head that has a [tense] value. We therefore revive and extend the ""Spec-Head agreement"" analyses first entertained by Saito & Murasugi (1990) and Lobeck (1995). Novel support for this analysis comes from the behaviour of VP ellipsis in copular clauses in which the occupant of SpecTP is not a standard referential DP, but an expletive or predicate (proform). We demonstrate that, in these ""Unusual Subject"" configurations, VP ellipsis is judged as acceptable only if T and the unusual subject engage in a Spec-Head agreement relationship. Because this correlation is also attested in Unusual Subject raising configurations and in Unusual Subject configurations in which British English do ellipsis occurs, we also provide new support for the proposal that matrix T licenses VP ellipsis in to-infinitive complement clauses (Zagona 1988, Lobeck 1995) and for the idea that British English do ellipsis is no different from standard VP ellipsis from a syntactic perspective (Thoms & Sailor 2018, contra Aelbrecht 2010, Baltin 2012). With respect to the timing of ellipsis, we provide decisive evidence against ""derivational-timing"" approaches to VP/do ellipsis in English.",1
"This paper deals with the evolution of nominal expressions with prenominal possessives in Romance languages. Until now, the prevalent view has been that their historical development follows one of the two diachronic paths: either they stop co-occurring with determiners (French, Spanish) or they start requiring their presence (European Portuguese). One common analysis associates the first case with a transition from a modifier to a determiner semantics of possessives and the second with a retention of a modifier semantics (e.g. Alexiadou 2004). It has also been observed, however, that documented Romance languages each make use of two morphologically distinct possessive paradigms, the so-called short and long forms, and, at least for French, that the short forms co-occur with determiners in historical documents less frequently than the long ones (Butet 2018). We adduce novel quantitative evidence from treebanks of French, Spanish, and Portuguese to the latter observation and show for the first time that the two paradigms followed very different evolutionary trajectories: frequency of determiners goes monotonically up with long possessives and goes up and then down with the short possessives across the three languages. Given these new data, we argue that the only point of evolutionary divergence in Romance possessive DPs is the choice of either the long or the short prenominal possessive in each of the languages, while the semantics of long and short possessives is stable both diachronically and across the three languages we examine. We also argue that the observed diachronic developments are consequences of a pan-Romance rise of a DP grammar. The paper thus contributes to our understanding of the emergence of DP in general and definiteness marking in particular, of the semantico-syntactic architecture of possessive DPs, as well as of the evolutionary divergence and convergence within a language family.",1
"The paper proposes that there is a *ABA morphological constraint on the marking of mass, count and plural denotations. I interpret this in terms of nesting structures, taking the mass denotation to be basic, with count nouns derived by a special head from the mass denotation, and the plural most complex (as in Borer 2005). I also focus on the fact that syncretism patterns among mass/count/plural denotations are influenced by case (structural vs. oblique), so that in some languages it looks like numerals combine with the plural in structural cases, and singular in obliques (or vice versa). The paper discusses data from (in no particular order) Estonian, North and South Saami, Finnish, Dutch, Russian, Serbian, Turkish, Digor Ossetic, Czech.",0
"This article documents a recent project translating Covid-19 information into Yiddish for the benefit of the Hasidic Jewish communities in London's Stamford Hill and Manchester in the UK. The translation work developed as a response to the urgent need for Yiddish-language resources specifically designed for the Hasidic community near the beginning of the pandemic. The translations were undertaken by a team consisting of linguists and native speakers of Hasidic Yiddish and took place within the framework of an AHRC (UK Arts and Humanities Research Council)-funded research project dedicated to linguistic and sociolinguistic analysis of contemporary Hasidic Yiddish worldwide. In this article we discuss the sociolinguistic background to the translations and investigate the reasons why they were so urgently needed, before going on to address the issues encountered during the course of the translation process and the decisions taken in order to resolve them. These issues include the type of Yiddish chosen for the translations, the translation of medical terminology, gender-based linguistic differences affecting the translations, and specific cultural considerations that needed to be taken into account.",0
"In this paper, I argue that declension classes are not primitives (see Aronoff (1994), Alexiadou (2004), Kramer (2015), i.a.), they are decomposed into simpler features, and gender is one of these features (Harris 1991, Wiese 2004, Caha 2019). The argument is based on mixed gender agreement in Russian, when a grammatically masculine noun can trigger feminine agreement if its referent is female (Mučnik 1971, Pesetsky 2013). Mixed agreement is grammatical only in those forms where a regular nominal exponent is syncretic to an exponent of a declension class that includes feminine nouns. In other forms, conflicting masculine and feminine gender features lead to ineffabiliaty in morphology (cf. Schütze (2003), Asarina (2011), Coon & Keine (2020)). Ineffability arises because the Subset Principle (Halle 1997) that holds between features of a vocabulary item and a terminal at the point of  Vocabulary Insertion is violated later in the derivation. This is in turn possible if Vocabulary Insertion that applies cyclically bottom-up (Bobaljik 2000) is interleaved with Lowering that alters structure below the triggering node (Embick & Noyer 2001). Finally, I show that Russian also has a number of cases where conflicting gender features in a noun phrase do not result in a realization failure (Iomdin 1980). The difference between these patterns is derived in a principled way and follows from the positions where conflicting features are introduced.",0
"Cross-linguistic generalizations about grammatical contexts favoring syncretism often have an implicational form. This paper shows that this is expected if (i) morphological paradigms are required to be both as small and as unambiguous as possible, (ii) languages may prioritize these requirements differently, and (iii) probability distributions for grammatical features interacting in syncretic patterns are fixed across languages. More specifically, this approach predicts that grammatical contexts that are less probable or more informative about a target grammatical feature T should favor syncretism of T cross-linguistically. The paper provides evidence for these predictions based on four detailed case
studies involving well-known patterns of contextual syncretism (gender syncretism based on number, gender syncretism based on person, aspect syncretism based on tense, and case syncretism based on animacy).",0
"The so-called directional verb compounds (cf. Li & Thompson 1981: 58) or directional constructions in Mandarin Chinese, 'V1displacement V2direction lái (come)/ qù (go)', e.g. bān chū lái 'transport exit come' = 'bring out (towards the speaker)' are not compounds, but genuine object sharing serial verb constructions in Collins' (1997) sense. The different positions of the shared internal argument are derived by raising one, two or three verbs to v, each verb adjoining to v as closely as possible (tucking in à la Richards 1997), thus maintaining the relative order between the verbs (cf. Collins 2002). This analysis automatically predicts that the internal argument must follow the verb (sequence) bearing the aspectual suffix, a correlation left unexplained in previous works.",0
"In this paper, we provide an initial overview of an understudied area of Icelandic morphosyntax, namely the effect of case syncretism of the acceptability of a variety of syntactic constructions. We outline a set of hypotheses as to how morphological case syncretism might interact with the narrow syntax, along with the empirical questions that need to be answered in order to test these hypotheses. We observe that the constructions we examine come in two types: cases where the construction makes it unclear which case to expect, and cases where the construction seems to simultaneously demand two distinct cases. We consider the possibility that the effects of case syncretism and its underlying causes may be distinct in these two kinds of constructions. Finally, we elaborate on five different kinds of syncretism, locating them in distinct parts of the grammar, leading to distinct predictions about how the resulting structures are affected.",0
"Arad (2003, 2005) has argued that syntactic composition begins with category-neutral roots rather than larger, already-categorized atoms like verbs and nouns. The argument was based on asymmetries reportedly observed in both English and Hebrew: a single root may acquire an idiosyncratic meaning or pronunciation up to the level of the first category-assigning head, but later morphology is semantically and phonologically predictable. This asymmetry was argued to suggest a locality constraint applying below the word level which would follow from independent syntactic constraints on the assumption that roots merge in the syntax. In this paper, we re-evaluate Arad's evidence for these asymmetries. We show that upon a closer look at the Hebrew and English facts, the predicted correlation between attachment height and semantic or phonological predictability is not observed. This undermines both the original argument for the syntactic reality of category-neutral roots, and its consequences for our understanding of locality restrictions on semantic and phonological interpretation.",0
"I argue that emojis are pictures, not a species of words, gestures, or expressives. 🎁 means that the world looks like that, from some viewpoint. I formalize this in terms of geometric projection with stylization. Since such a pictorial semantics delivers only very minimal contents I add an account of pragmatic enrichment, driven by coherence and metaphor. The apparent semantic distinction between emojis depicting entities and those depicting facial expressions I analyze as a difference between truth-conditional and use-conditional pictorial content: 🎁 depicts what the world of evaluation looks like, while 😄 depicts what the utterance context looks like. Combined with the idea that the speaker's facial expressions thus depicted by face emojis are themselves expressive, I derive the intuition that face emojis can be used to express emotional states, while maintaining that they are pictures.",0
"New words are regularly introduced to communities, yet not all of these words persist in a community's lexicon. Among the many factors contributing to lexical change, we focus on the understudied effect of social networks. We conduct a large-scale analysis of over 80k neologisms in 4420 online communities across a decade. Using Poisson regression and survival analysis, our study demonstrates that the community's network structure plays a significant role in lexical change. Apart from overall size, properties including dense connections, the lack of local clusters and more external contacts promote lexical innovation and retention. Unlike offline communities, these topic-based communities do not experience strong lexical levelling despite increased contact but accommodate more niche words. Our work provides support for the sociolinguistic hypothesis that lexical change is partially shaped by the structure of the underlying network but also uncovers findings specific to online communities.",1
"This paper explores the notion of subjecthood in West Circassian, a polysynthetic language with ergative alignment, by analyzing patterns of anaphor binding, a standard subjecthood diagnostic. The two types of anaphors in the language, reflexives and reciprocals, seem to display an opposite directionality in binding: reflexives appear to provide evidence for a syntactically accusative clause structure, with the ergative external argument c-commanding the absolutive theme, while reciprocals provide evidence for a syntactically ergative clause structure wherein the absolutive theme c-commands and binds the ergative agent. The close examination of the expression of reflexive and reciprocal relations in a variety of contexts uncovers the generalization that both types of pronouns behave as standard anaphors subject to standard locality conditions on binding, but reflexives are additionally constrained by a licensing condition which limits their set of possible antecedents to the highest argument in the theta-domain. The puzzling mismatch in binding directionality is thus reduced to well-understood and cross-linguistically attested patterns. The paper sheds light on the syntactic conditions governing anaphor licensing and on the role of subjecthood as a type of syntactic primitive: in West Circassian, subjecthood diagnostics fail to single out a single nominal as a subject, thus rendering this notion theoretically vacuous.",0
"This article presents the results of investigations using topic modeling of the Voynich Manuscript (Beinecke Library MS408). Topic modeling is a set of computational methods which are used to identify clusters of subjects within text. We use latent dirichlet allocation, latent semantic analysis, and nonnegative matrix factorization to cluster Voynich pages into `topics'. We then compare the topics derived from the computational models to clusters derived from the Voynich illustrations and from paleographic analysis. We find that computationally derived clusters match closely to a conjunction of scribe and subject matter (as per the illustrations), providing further evidence that the Voynich Manuscript contains meaningful text.",0
"This paper proposes that just like phonologists, linguists working on morphosyntax should have a core set of standard terms that are understood in exactly the same way across the discipline. Most of these terms are traditional terms that are given a standard retro-definition, because linguists already behave as if these terms had the same meaning for everyone. The definitions are definitions of general concepts (i.e. comparative concepts, applicable to all languages in exactly the same way), but they are expected to be highly similar to language-particular categories with the same labels. If linguists were close to finding out the true natural-kind categories of Human Language that all grammars consist of, there would be no need for definitions, but since this seems to be a remote goal, research on general linguistics must rely on uniformly defined general terms.",0
"The linguist Benjamin Whorf in a classic article, ""Grammatical Categories"" presents a general theory of grammatical categories independent of the Indo-European Latin and Greek model categorization of ""form classes"" (e.g. Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Preposition). Whorf suggested three contrasting dimensions of form variation: overt, covert, and isosemantic. Each of these three was further divided into ""selective"" and ""modulus"" categories. The need for a more flexible view of form class was also promulgated by John R. (Haj) Ross in suggesting that linguistic analysis should emphasize 'nouniness"" and ""verbiness"" rather than rigid form class categorization.
In this paper I will explore Whorf's system, and Ross' call for form class flexibility in three non-Western languages, Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic, whose morphosyntactic systems are not easily analyzed using the form classes of Indo-European languages. In Chinese, individual ""words"" 词 cí, can be seen simultaneously as ""nouns,"" ""verbs,"" or ""adjectives."" For example the morpheme长 (cháng, zhǎng ) can be classified as a noun, a verb, an adjective or an adverb indicating ""length"" among numerous other meanings.
Chinese and many Japanese ""compound words"" generally consist of two or more character-morphemes that can be interpreted semantically as ""phrases,"" for example, in Chinese 买卖 (lit. buy-sell) has the meaning ""business.""
Japanese has several other grammatical structures that do not fit easily into Western form class systems. One example is the ""adjectival verb"" ( 形容詞 keiyōshi) in which no formal distinction exists between ""verbs"" , and ""adjectives"" in that both can be ""conjugated,"" for example, 赤い (akaii)""red,"" 赤だった (akadatta) ""was red.""
2
Arabic has a system of differentiating form classes by creating 15 (10 in common use) separate structural categories based on triliteral consonant roots which transcend strict classification into Western grammatical form classes. The Arabic word conventionally translated as ""noun"" in English, سس pl. سسسسس , ism pl. asmaa' is equivalent in function to a range of Western form classes: nouns, pronouns, adjectives , and adverbs. In most cases asmaa' are derived from structures that also yield equivalent verbs, for example, سسسس سسسسس yaktub kitabanaan ""he writes a book,"" where both words are based on the same triliteral root, س س س k-t-b denoting ""writing.""
In this paper I maintain that it is more accurate to look at the grammatical form classes in these non-Western languages by examining their specific functions within their respective languages rather than trying to forcibly analyze them through the lens of structures dictated by Western languages. Taking Ross' notion of flexibility in form classes and Whorf's more universal typological proposal, I will show how a more universal form class analysis can provide a more accurate picture of form class, one that might productively be applied to a revised analysis of Western languages as well.",0
"What are the basic syntactic pieces underlying person systems, and how does the grammar combine and manipulate these pieces? Most discussion of these questions has taken place against a relatively standard backdrop of assumptions concerning the possible meanings of the semantic primitives to which syntactic pieces or features correspond. First person, for instance, refers to the individual who is speaking; second person refers to the individual who is being addressed. This paper explores what can be learned about the syntactic and semantic representation of person from cases where this baseline behavior fails to hold. Three case studies are presented. The first investigates the relationship between second person features and first person features, focusing in particular on cases where first person shifts but second person does not. I show that (perhaps surprisingly) these facts are compatible both with a theory with dedicated second person features and with a theory positing only speaker and participant features. The second case study explores the nature of locative expressions, and in particular the proposal from Harbour 2016 that words such as ""here"" have person features at their core. I argue against this proposal based on cases where first person shifts but locatives do not. Lastly, the third case study investigates the nature of person inflection in languages such as Amharic, which contain indexiphors (Deal 2018). I argue that ""first person inflection"" in this language reflects a syncretism between two separate types of features, properly indexical first person features (which reference the author of the context) and indexiphoric author features (which reference the author of the index of interpretation). Syncretism of this type suggests that standard first person features are not themselves primitive, but rather consist at the ""subatomic'' level of a specification of the author function and a specification of the formal object (the context) to which this function applies.",0
"In the contemporary Nepali speech community of Sikkim and Darjeeling, there is an internal dynamics about ethnicity within which the issue of language is embedded and has been a defining factor of the dynamics. The region's populace is identified as ""indigenous"" and their languages ""endangered"" in the lines of the UN's parameters. With depleting linguistic diversities, lack of documentation and lack of public discourse on the issue of language endangerment, this paper advocates that Sikkim, Darjeeling and Doars is a ""language hotspot,"" and requires a language policy geared towards ""language documentation"" to empower the region's endangered languages and their indigenous speakers.",0
"This paper describes a *local > local ditransitive person restriction in Kipsigis (Kalenjin; Nilo-Saharan) and argues that this restriction must be morphological. Ditransitive person restrictions are often analyzed syntactically, as with the Person-Case Constraint (PCC). However, the Kipsigis pattern differs from traditional PCC effects in that only local > local object combinations are ungrammatical--an unattested pattern--and *local > local is tied to morphological competition. I argue that the Kipsigis facts must be accounted for morphologically and suggest that the source of ditransitive person restrictions varies cross-linguistically, stemming in some cases from the syntax and in others the morphology.",0
"This paper provides a semantic account for a verbal construction which disobeys many purported limits on the events which may be encoded in a single clause. In the ""associated motion"" construction in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (Oto-Manguean, Oaxaca), verbs marked with certain prefixes (the venitive and andative) indicate that the event denoted by the verb is preceded by a motion event of coming or going. It is shown that within this construction, (i) a sequence of sub-events lacking temporal adjacency are nevertheless presented as a single meta-event, and (ii) subjects are required to be intentional participants. To deal with these puzzles, the analysis proposed (i) takes the sub-events to be related via a temporally diffuse causal relation (enablement) and (ii) proposes that intention is derived from an entailment that the entire meta-event is the result of an intentional state held by the subject (a plan). Further discussion highlights how associated motion resembles a larger class of exceptionally complex events which also require intentionality, suggesting that plans may underpin a unified theory of exceptional event complexity.",0
"In the present study, we investigated estar constructions in the Spanish/English codeswitching variety of Northern Belize, which is well known for its prolific use of hacer bilingual compound verbs in codeswitched speech. To this end, we extracted and analyzed 364 unilingual Spanish
and 158 bilingual estar constructions from naturalistic speech in order (i) to examine the occurrence of estar with predicative adjectives, present participles, and past participles in both unilingual and code-switched discourse; and (ii) to determine how type of bilingualism (emergent vs. dynamic) and frequency of use of hacer bilingual compound verbs, influence the naturalistic production of estar constructions. Results revealed that the production of estar with English predicative adjectives and English past participles was favored in bilingual discourse. Importantly, the use of 'estar + English past participle' constructions was favored by dynamic
bilinguals who more frequently employed hacer 'do' bilingual compound verbs. Our findings highlight the important role that bilingual competence play in the naturalistic production of congruent structures in codeswitched speech.",0
"We present experimental evidence in favor of Harley & Haugen's (2007) proposal that the acceptability of denominals in sentences with prepositional objects is determined by the degree of similarity of their prepositional objects to their nominal roots in various respects (shape, function, material). In contrast to Kiparsky (1997), we argue that all denominals are derived from nominal roots regardless of their alleged (in)ability to combine with PP-objects different from the root (""hammer with a shoe"" versus ""*tape with pushpins""). On the basis of an experiment eliciting English similarity judgments, we show that nominal roots are not just defined by one predominant semantic aspect (as in Dowd 2010), but by a variety of aspects (shape, function, material, a.o.), along the lines of the Qualia Structure theory of concepts proposed by Pustejovsky (1995). Shape, function and material all have a large effect on denominal sentence acceptability, and we conclude that acceptability is best accounted for by all of these aspects and possibly others.",0
"Many of the world's languages feature an open lexical class of ideophones, words whose marked forms and sensory meanings invite iconic associations. Ideophones (also known as mimetics or expressives) are well-known from languages in Asia, Africa and the Americas, where they often form a class on the same order of magnitude as other major word classes and take up a considerable functional load as modifying expressions or predicates. Across languages, commonalities in the morphosyntactic behaviour of ideophones can be related to their nature and origin as vocal depictions. At the same time there is ample room for linguistic diversity, raising the need for fine-grained grammatical description of ideophone systems. As vocal depictions, ideophones often form a distinct lexical stratum seemingly conjured out of thin air; but as conventionalized words, they inevitably grow roots in local linguistic systems, showing relations to adverbs, adjectives, verbs and other linguistic resources devoted to modification and predication.",0
"This paper examines properties of noun-classifier compounds (N-Cl compounds) in Mandarin Chinese, in relation to pre-nominal classifier structures. We first argue that N-Cl compounds are generated by head movement of nouns to the same type of ClassifierP projection that hosts pre-nominal classifiers, based on the observation that all classifiers participate in the same selection relations involving delimitability (Zhang 2013). We argue that N-to-Cl head movement results in the extension of the NP phase to ClP (Den Dikken 2007), predicting key distributional differences between compound-internal and pre-nominal classifiers. Finally, we discuss a pattern in which N-Cl compounds are preceded by a pre-nominal classifier, in relation to the fact that the same combinations of classifiers cannot co-occur in pre-nominal positions. We propose that nominal expressions in Mandarin can contain multiple ClP projections, and that the attested restrictions on ClP recursion are best captured in terms of the distinctness condition (Richards 2010). In addition to building a non-lexicalist theory of compound formation, our account offers a new explanation for why the heads of articulated functional sequences (Rizzi 1997, et seq.) are often not simultaneously visible: sequences of overt functional heads are typically filtered out by distinctness, but articulated structures can surface when the restriction is obviated by phase-extending head movement.",0
"In this chapter, we will focus on German as one of the core Standard Average European (SAE) languages (Haspelmath 2001; Haspelmath et al. 2005) and review some of the results of previous investigations, yet from a different angle: By also taking into consideration older stages of this language (most notably Old High German, spoken/written in the period between 750–1050) and several modern dialects, we offer a more nuanced perspective. What is more, we address several problems that arise with the definition and scope of the SAE features mentioned in the literature.",0
"This article proposes a Nanosyntactic approach to root suppletion. We show that within this theory, there is a straightforward way to account for root suppletion within a strictly modular theory of grammar. As a starting point, we first focus on the architectural difficulties that arise in the Distributed Morphology approach to Late Insertion. We then show how Nanosyntax circumvents these problems, and address two potential empirical issues for the Nanosyntactic treatment (multiple exponence and locality), showing how they provide support for the approach proposed.",0
"We propose a theory of root suppletion based on a single syntactic √ node. We show that for such a theory to be possible, a distinction must be made between syntactic √s and morphological roots. We argue against standard approaches to root suppletion like Harley (2014), Haugen and Siddiqi (2013), who differentiate √s in syntax.",0
"Tuparí, an indigenous Brazilian language of the Tupían family, has innovated a highly productive finite embedded clause construction that retains the morphosyntactic hallmarks of matrix clauses – without any neutralization in tense or evidentiality. I offer a synchronic analysis of these finite embedded clauses and propose a specific grammaticalization pathway that can account for their diachronic emergence: the clausal nominalizer hè developed out of a homophonous third person pronoun, allowing for paratactic constructions to be reanalyzed as involving true subordination. Both functions of hè (as a pronoun and as a clausal nominalizer) remain in use today, giving rise to occasional ambiguity. An additional aim of this paper is to evaluate the Tuparí facts in light of the literature on the Final-over-Final Condition (FOFC), a proposed syntactic universal. I will show that the language's embedded clauses are unexpected on the most restrictive formulation of FOFC (Holmberg 2000) but can be accommodated without issue once FOFC is restricted to apply within Extended Projections. Situating Tuparí in the broader FOFC typology allows for a more fine-grained understanding of the distribution of the categorial features [+NOMINAL] and [+VERBAL] in the language's syntax. http://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.1394",0
"Kodi is an Austronesian language spoken in Sumba Island, Nusa Tenggara Timur Province, eastern Indonesia. Even though some work has been done on Kodi (Sukerti 2013, inter alia), it remains a largely under-documented language. Further, Kodi is vulnerable or threatened because Indonesian, the prestigious national language, is used in most sociolinguistic domains outside the domestic sphere (e.g., education, public offices, religious services). It has also penetrated almost every Kodi household through such things as media and information technology (e.g., television and smartphones). Current research aims to collect audio-visual data to meet the urgent need for fuller documentation and preservation of Kodi language and culture.",0
"In this squib, Norris describes a pattern of hybrid agreement in number that is found in Estonian and Finnish numeral-noun constructions (NNCs). Norris argues that this empirical pattern cannot be straightforwardly analyzed without an appeal to functional structure. This is in part a response to Bruening (2020), who argues against the DP hypothesis by presenting NP-only analyses of three prominent generalizations previously argued to require DP (hybrid agreement in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian among them). Hybrid agreement in Estonian/Finnish differs from hybrid agreement in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian in key ways that cause problems for Bruening's (2020) lexical analysis. Norris argues instead for a structural analysis of hybrid agreement (in Estonian/Finnish). In so doing, he argues that it is an argument in favor of the DP hypothesis, i.e., the necessity of nominals headed by something other than N.

"In Modern Greek, clitic doubling can target just the first conjunct of a coordinated phrase. We argue that first conjunct clitic doubling provides crucial evidence in favor of a pure Agree-based account of clitic doubling, and against movement-based approaches: if clitic doubling in this language involved movement, then first conjunct doubling would constitute a violation of the Coordinate Structure Constraint, which Greek obeys. This problem does not arise under an approach that implements doubling as feature copying/sharing in the absence of movement.",1
"The literature on Slavic aspect uses the notion of ""derivational history"" (ascribed to Karcevski 1927) to connect derivationally verbs that have a related meaning but differ in the morphological aspect and in the presence of various aspectual morphemes. In this squib, I show that this concept can be modeled in terms of the bottom-up morphosyntactic derivation and propose to derive the cyclic morphological aspect behavior of Slavic verbs with the operation Agree, in connection with minimality based on dominance relations in the verbal head composed by head movement.",1
"Traditional approaches to verbal periphrasis (compound tenses) treat auxiliary verbs as lexical items that enter syntactic derivation like any other lexical item, i.e. via Selection/Merge. An alternative view that has received much attention in recent years is that auxiliary verbs are not base-generated but rather inserted in a previously built structure (i.a. Bach 1967; Embick 2000; Arregi 2000; Cowper 2010; Bjorkman 2011; Arregi & Klecha 2015). Arguments for the insertion approach to auxiliaries include their last-resort distribution and the fact that, in many languages, auxiliaries are not systematically associated with a given inﬂectional category (the ""overﬂow"" distribution discussed in Bjorkman 2011). In this paper, I argue against the insertion approach. First, I demonstrate that the overﬂow pattern and last-resort distribution follow from Cyclic Selection (Pietraszko 2017) – a Merge-counterpart of Cyclic Agree (Béjar & Rezac 2009). And second, I show that the insertion approach makes wrong predictions about compound tenses in Swahili, a language with overﬂow periphrasis. Under the approach advocated here, an auxiliary verb is a verbal head externally merged as a speciﬁer of a functional head, such as T. It then undergoes m-merger with that head, instantiating an external-merge version of Matushansky's (2006) conception of head movement.",0
"In Western Armenian, verbs obligatorily contain a root, one of three theme vowels, and an inflectional suffix. Theme vowels are ornamental morphs whose presence and quality are determined jointly by the root, the verbalizer v, and Voice. The choice of theme vowel is partly governed by transitivity but also shows arbitrariness, which is root-conditioned. The appearance of theme vowels correlates with the presence of verbal semantics and morphosyntactic structure, including Voice. Data from lexical causatives and from subordinate compounds show that theme vowels cannot be identified either with verbalizers or with Voice, but their information is distributed among both of these and the root.",1
"Raimy (1999;  2000a;  2000b) proposed a graphical formalism for modeling reduplication, originallymostly focused on phonological overapplication in a derivational framework. This framework is now known as Precedence-based phonology or Multiprecedence phonology. Raimy's idea is that the segments at the input to the phonology are not totally ordered by precedence. This paper tackles a challenge that arose with Raimy's work, the development of a deterministic serialization algorithm as part of the derivation of surface forms. The Match-Extend algorithm introduced here requires fewer assumptions and sticks tighter to the attested typology. The algorithm also contains no parameter or constraint specific to individual graphs or topologies, unlike previous proposals. Match-Extend requires nothing except knowing the last added set of links.",0
"Cantonese substitutes a base tone with either a high-level or high-rising tone in certain derived environments, a kind of process morphology dubbed pinjam (變音) ""changed tone"". We develop a comprehensive analysis of Cantonese pinjam morphology that predicts this tonal change as the realization of a tonal affix that is shaped by both language particular patterns and universal constraints. The predictions of this core analysis are then used to explore a range of morphological and syntactic constructions that also have a pinjam, but have not been fully analyzed in prior research. This investigation also makes an empirical contribution by showing how the core analysis can extend naturally to many under-studied constructions, as well as documenting some of the limits of this analysis.",0
"I document and analyze the prosodic and morphological structure of the verb in Paraguayan Guaraní (Tupian, ISO 639-3: gug), a heavily agglutinating language. I show that Paraguayan Guaraní suffixes are independently prosodified and, to a large extent, freely ordered. Following Bickel et al.'s (2007) account of Chintang (Kiranti, ISO 639-3: ctn), I propose that variable affix order arises as a consequence of suffixes subcategorizing for prosodic words. 

I contrast this phonological account of variable affix order with morphological analyses, which model variable affix order with freely ranked morphotactic constraints. The morphological accounts predict that variable affix order is the marked pattern which has to be posited by the learner for each pair of permuting affixes. The phonological account predicts that variable affix order is the default. Both accounts find empirical support from cross-linguistic data. Thus, I propose that the phenomenon of variable affix order is not unified, but rather that it is driven by either phonology or morphology, giving rise to two distinct typological profiles.",0
"In the Minimalist framework of Chomsky (2000, 2001, et seq.), all syntactic dependencies are regulated by the abstract operation Agree. This handbook article serves to provide an overview of the pair of grammatical elements involved in the Agree operation, termed the probe and goal. We will see that Agree between a probe and goal is possible only if there exists a fundamental featural asymmetry between them. Concretely, the probe is deficient for one or more syntactic features which the goal bears. Agree is then viewed, broadly speaking, as an operation which is triggered to resolve this featural asymmetry. In addition, the probe and goal pair are structurally, and potentially also categorially, asymmetric: e.g. the probe and goal stand in a c-command relationship and typically belong to distinct grammatical categories. At the same time, for two grammatical elements to qualify as a matching probe-goal pair, in the first place, they must share some core syntactic properties. The central goal of this paper is to explore the upper and lower limits of this syntactic space: i.e. to lay out what featural and structural properties two grammatical elements must share to be identified as a probe-goal pair in the first place, and what properties must minimally distinguish one from the other for the purposes of Agree.",1
"This dissertation explores the syntactic and semantic properties of implicit arguments in various voice constructions, such as active and passive voice, applicatives, causatives and impersonals, using mainly Sason Arabic (SA) and Turkish as empirical starting points.

I add to the typology of null arguments, further demonstrating that they do not form a homogeneous category (e.g. Williams 1985; Rizzi 1986; Bhatt and Pancheva 2017; Landau 2010). My investigation reveals (at least) four types of implicit arguments in languages under investigation in terms of their semantic properties and syntactic visibility: (i) an existentially closed passive agent, (ii) a full DP, (iii) a free variable, and (iv) an impersonal pronoun.

Establishing a distinction in Turkish between two constructions with identical morphology, i.e., passive and impersonal, I show that the implicit agent of passive is unprojected, whereas the null impersonal pronoun is fully projected. I also demonstrate that purported 'passives of passives' in Turkish are in fact impersonals of passives, and passives cannot iterate. This follows from an analysis of passive as a subtype of Voice, the head that introduces the external θ-role (following Legate 2014). I compare the null impersonal with the overt impersonal insan 'human' in Turkish, indicating that they exhibit distinct behavior. I also provide a syntactic analysis of the passive that confirms and captures the generalization that passive cannot iterate (Perlmutter and Postal 1977).

The approach to passive adopted in the dissertation predicts that an active-passive-like alternation should be available to other functional categories, such as ApplP or CauseeP. Accordingly, I investigate several morphological and periphrastic causative constructions from SA and Turkish, arguing that this prediction is borne out. While all the causatives embed a second VoiceP, the behavior of this VoiceP varies across causative constructions: some are like the canonical, agentive VoiceP, whereas the behavior of others warrants identifying them as distinct categories, specifically VoicecauseeP or CauseeP.

Furthermore, the investigation of 'make' causatives in SA reveals that the embedded agent may be present (i) as a free variable on thematic, active Voice head (à la Heim 1982) without needing a specifier or (ii) as a full DP, which is separated from its licensor by a phase domain and needs to Ā-move to be (Case)-licensed.",0
"I propose that second position clitics in A'ingae are C-heads of matrix clauses.

A'ingae (or Cofán, ISO 639-3: con) is an Amazonian isolate spoken by the Cofán people in northeast Ecuador and southern Colombia. The language is endangered and severely underdocumented.

A'ingae has relatively free word order in matrix clauses, discontinuous constituency, and extensive pro-drop. Thus, it shows the typical hallmarks of a non-configurational language.

Nevertheless, I argue that A'ingae has a configurational CP projection, which can be diagnosed by second-position (P2) clitics.",0
"This paper attempts to pinpoint the derivational timing of ellipsis by examining how it interacts with other phenomena whose timing is better understood. It is demonstrated that for morphophonological processes such as external sandhi and allomorphy, material adjacent to an ellipsis site cannot ""see"" ellipsis-internal material. Under the mainstream [E]-based approach to ellipsis, this result indicates that the silence characterizing ellipsis arises early at PF, consistent with non-application of Vocabulary Insertion (and inconsistent with phonological deletion). However, it would also follow straightforwardly if ellipsis sites were sent to the interfaces alone, the moment they are licensed in the syntax (Aelbrecht 2010). This approach, involving what I call the 'Segregated Transfer' of ellipsis sites, is pursued here: beyond the mounting syntactic evidence supporting it, it is shown to be preferable on post-syntactic grounds as well, requiring fewer assumptions to capture the novel findings presented here.",0
"When second language (L2) learners are faced with acquiring a grammar that is a subset of their native language (L1) grammar, direct positive evidence is often unavailable. In view of this, we experimentally examine whether learners can instead use indirect positive evidence: evidence drawn from errors in a learner's L1 made by native speakers of the learner's L2. We test whether naïve English-speaking learners of Mandarin can determine that plural morphology is not obligatorily marked on Mandarin nominals. Participants were exposed to a dialogue in English providing indirect positive evidence for the absence of plural marking in Mandarin: plural deletion errors in the Mandarin speaker's English productions. After learning 12 pseudo-Mandarin nouns in singular contexts, participants were tested on their word learning knowledge, using both singular and plural pictures as prompts. 40% of learners correctly deduced that the same string to which they had assigned some singular interpretation was also appropriate in plural contexts, demonstrating sensitivity to the indirect positive evidence they were exposed to in the dialogue. We conclude that indirect positive evidence is likely an effective way for language learners to acquire a grammar that is a subset of their native language grammar.",0
"This paper explores a phenomenon of English in which out‐ combines with a predicate to form a complex predicate (e.g., outsing, outdo, outrun, outsmart, ...), here called ""out‐PRED"". A thorough investigation uncovers several new generalizations, leading to analyses (i) that out‐PRED formation is productive and syntactic, building upon the structure for PRED, and (ii) that out‐ is the core of the out‐PRED clause's extended verbal projection. These findings are derived via a derivation in which out‐ merges with PRED before any argument(s) can merge. This is then further supported by exploring domains in which out‐PRED is unavailable; though these seemingly unrelated, they share deep derivational properties that are incompatible with the derivation of out‐PRED. These findings have implications for the syntactic representation of argument structure more generally, supporting analyses where all arguments of a verb are syntactically severed from it.",1
"Much recent research argues that case markers frequently have a richer internal structure than their surface appearance suggests. Furthermore, based on cross-linguistic facts about phenomena like suppletion and syncretism, work in this vein argues that case features involve an implicational containment hierarchy, in which (among other relations) oblique cases contain the features of accusative case. Using fieldwork data on Balkar, a vulnerable Turkic language spoken in southern Russia, I argue for new evidence that oblique cases contain the accusative. In brief, Balkar shows an alternation in certain possessed NPs that is endemic to accusative and oblique cases, in precisely the way that the case containment hypothesis predicts.",0
"Do systematic interpretive contrasts across languages derive from the employment of universal grammatical building blocks, or do they stem from differing semantic specifications on simplex formatives that feed into (Neo- Gricean) pragmatic reasoning? Is evidence for grammatical features underlying a particular contrast in one language an argument for those features being universal and thus present in another language where such evidence is lacking? In this paper, we explore this complex of big-picture questions on the basis of so-called *ABA patterns, especially in the area of nominal pro-forms i.e. the various types of anaphors and pronouns. To sharpen the issues, we compare two radically opposed perspectives, which we dub Rich Universal Base and Poor Universal Base. We show that either one could in principle account for the basic *ABA facts, leaving the door open for an unsatisfying debate on conceptual and aesthetic grounds. We thus explore ways in which the debate can be put back onto an empirical footing by identifying distinct predictions that the two approaches make for the behavior of surface forms that are ambiguous between anaphoric and pronominal reference. We then use these to develop concrete diagnostics and give a preliminary demonstration of how they might be applied in languages with the right cluster of properties to empirically resolve the debate.",0
"In this paper, I address the complex facts of glottalization in A'ingae (or Cofán, an Amazonian isolate, ISO 639-3: con). I argue that A'ingae glottalization has two morphosyntactically-conditioned representations: Within the verbal inflectional domain, glottalization is a laryngeal feature of the metrical foot, which I will represent as (σ́σ)ˀ. Within the larger predicate domain, it is a regular glottal stop, represented with ʔ. Thus, I show that the phonemic status of glottalization varies with word-internal morphosyntax.",0
"I demonstrate (i) that verbal stress assignment in A'ingae targets the right edge of the verbal inflectional domain, showing sensitivity to morphological domains, and (ii) that particular morphemes delete preceding stress, showing morpheme-specific effects. Thus, a pattern which at first sight could be described as irregular is really systematic when morphological domains and morphemes-specific stress rules are considered. Previous descriptions of the language do not fully capture stress facts (Fischer and Hengeveld, in press; Repetti-Ludlow et al., 2019).",0
"Recent syntactic approaches to the causative alternation treat it as a Voice alternation (e.g., Marantz 2013, Alexiadou et al. 2015, Wood 2015, Wood and Marantz 2017, Kastner 2020, Nie 2020, Tyler 2020). These theories adopt an architecture in which little v and Voice are two separate heads; little v verbalizes the root and introduces event semantics, while Voice introduces the external argument (e.g., Pylkkänen 2008, Harley 2013, Legate 2014). What they argue, then, is that the causative and anticausative variant have the same vP (event) layer, but differ in the type of Voice head (e.g., transitive or intransitive) that they merge with. In this brief paper, I present a detailed investigation of the causative alternation in Kipsigis (Nilotic; Kenya), based on data from original fieldwork. I show that the causative alternation in the language cannot be just a Voice alternation: (in)transitivity in the language is calcuated at the little v level for most verbs. I therefore conclude that while Voice theories of the alternation have many advantages (and are most likely correct) for some languages, they are not able to account for all cross-linguistic variation in the phenomenon, at least not without further modifications.",0
"The intriguing fact about human language is that neither the sound systems nor the thought systems--technically called Sensorimotor and Conceptual-intentional systems--have any significant precedence prior to the emergence of the hominid line. So, a theory of language needs to explain where they came from and how they fell into place to create the conditions for unbounded generativity. In effect, language-theory needs to explain two novel factors in the evolution of human language: word-formation and word-combination. In this context, the recent proposal that the sound component of language is 'ancillary', and that language is basically designed for thought, is problematic. This is because the proposal turns the origin of the rich structure of human thought into a mystery since the units of human thought could not have been borrowed from, say, the apes. To look for an alternative explanation, we study Darwin's idea that (a) the sound system might have evolved in part from a pre-existing human music system, (b) the evolving sound systems might have 'acted on' rudimentary units of thought systems to turn them into words. We critically evaluate Darwin's picture. In the process, we locate the gaps in Darwin's story that must be filled to reach a more complete theory of language.

The new version adds these line: ""In that sense, sound-meaning corelations were internally required in the language system for the system to take off as a generative procedure. Externalization of thought was not a necessary feature of the device at all.""",0
"The theory of Gradient Symbolic Representation posits that phonological structures can be partially activated, going beyond the traditional binary presence vs. absence dichotomy. In this paper, we propose that morphological structures can also be partially activated. Empirical evidence comes from the patterns of Rendaku in Japanese surname compounds. Rendaku is a morphophonological process in which the initial voiceless obstruent of the second member of a compound becomes voiced. Lyman's Law blocks this process if there is already a voiced obstruent in the second member, but a voiced obstruent in the first member does not block Rendaku; i.e. Lyman's Law does not apply across a morpheme boundary. However, in surname compounds, the presence of a voiced obstruent in the first member substantially reduces the applicability of Rendaku, unlike in regular compounds. At the descriptive level, surname compounds behave ambiguously between monomorphemic and heteromorphemic words: they undergo the compound voicing process but are also probabilistically subject to the morpheme-internal restriction against multiple voiced obstruents. We demonstrate that this observation can be formally modeled by positing a partially activated morpheme boundary in surname compounds. A quantitative modeling of the data is developed using Gradient Symbolic Representation coupled with Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar.",0
"Verbs in Western Armenian (Indo-European) inflect for both subject agreement and tense. Subject and tense marking is often fused, which makes segmentation difficult. We show that, despite surface fusion, verbal inflection in Western Armenian is fundamentally agglutinative. By segmenting subject and tense suffixes across the verbal paradigm, we capture syncretic patterns and other interactions between inflectional slots that a fusional account does not. Our analysis requires limited but systematic use of zero morphs. Our agglutinative model of Western Armenian verbs reveals that inwardly-sensitive morphologically-conditioned allomorphy has priority over its outwardly-sensitive counterpart.",0
". In section 1, I present a recent formalisation of modification and conjunction structures by Chomsky (2020), in terms of sequences of pair merge units, each including a Link element identified with the nominaliser/verbaliser n/v.

in the form of (nominal) linkers. In section 4, I suggest that case stacking and Concord may also be viewed as a manifestation of Links.",0
"This paper explores branching vocabulary items as a possible alternative to backtracking in Nanosyntax. Such vocabulary items give rise to the possibility of partial overwrite. Initially, they spell out a node with two phrasal daughters. Subsequently, the right branch is interpreted by a new element, but the original item continues to spell out the left branch of such a derivation. The effects that branching vocabulary items give rise to thus mimic aspects of backtracking, but do not require undoing parts of the derivation.

"The grammatical notion of switch reference refers to morphological markers that track whether the subjects of two related clauses are coreferent (Jacobsen 1967). We argue in this paper for a treatment of switch reference as index agreement, based on the behavior of switch reference in Washo (Hokan/isolate; USA). We propose that switch reference marking arises as the result of multiple agreement between C in an embedded clause and the referential index values of the subject in that embedded clause and the subject in its superordinate clause. The morphemes representing both different and same subject marking are then the exponence of the presence or absence, respectively, of conflict in the featural make up of C. We argue that, unlike alternatives based on coordination, control, or binding, an agreement-based account explains several core properties of the phenomenon in Washo, including the distribution and internal structure of clauses marked for switch reference, as well as the exponence of switch reference in cases of reference overlap. More generally, switch reference in Washo provides evidence that Agree can be bidirectional (downward and upward), as well as for the existence of referential indices as true syntactic objects that participate in syntactic operations.",1
"This paper investigates linear and non-linear morphology in verbal inflection in Ebira, a Benue-Congo language of Nigeria. Non-linear morphology does not appear on the root, but rather occurs within pre-verbal units called STAMP markers or STAMP portmanteaux, a mnemonic for subject agreement, tense, aspect, mood, and polarity. Based on the previous description of Ebira morphosyntax, this paper decomposes its STAMP markers into several sub-STAMP morphs. Specifically, inflectional categories for subject agreement (1S, 2, 3S, 1P, 3P), aspect/mood (HABITUAL, COMPLETIVE, SUBJUNCTIVE, CONTINUOUS, PERFECT), polarity (NEGATIVE), and clause-level meanings (INTERROGATIVE, 'IF', 'WHEN') are decomposed into various floating tones, floating moras, and unassociated segments. By decomposing STAMPs in this way, it makes testable predictions for future Ebira studies, as not all logically possible category combinations have been investigated yet. This paper concludes by discussing the areality of STAMP markers in West and Central Africa (the so-called Macro-Sudan Belt), which is complicated by analytic vs. synthetic transcription practices by linguists. In order to circumvent issues of transcription, I propose that the areality of STAMP markers in Africa be based on whether the individual STAMP categories form a constituent before and to the exclusion of the verb root, requiring explicit evidence independent from transcription practices.",0

"Suppletive allomorphs may be conditioned based on their phonological environment. When the allomorphy distribution is phonologically natural, this has motivated theoretical models supporting phonologically-optimizing suppletive allomorphy (POSA), whereby the phonological grammar selects the suppletive allomorph whose output is least marked. This paper re-examines four cases argued to support POSA in Irish, Tiene, Katu, and Konni, and for each provides counter-arguments against this position. In contrast to POSA, I assert that the most straightforward analysis is to formalize the conditioning phonological environment via subcategorization frames, and that the burden of proof falls on proponents of POSA to show otherwise. Subcategorization correctly predicts that subcategorized phonological material is the only phonological material which suppletion can be sensitive to. [An appendix is provided which argues against POSA in another language, Udihe, and instead posits a single underlying form with gradient representations.]",1
"Deictic paradigms show a asymmetry in their diachronic development. While the deictic categories expressed by pronominal and possessive paradigms are overall stable, demonstrative paradigms can undergo a reorganisation that typically results, from a diachronic viewpoint, in a reduction in the number of deictic oppositions encoded in the system. In this paper, I provide an account for these different diachronic behaviours. I assume, with Harbour (2016) i.a., that demonstrative systems are defined by person features, on a par with pronominal and possessive ones. I also posit that these three classes of deictics show structural differences as to how person features are encoded in their internal structure. Thus, revisiting Polinsky's (2018) intuition that stability is linked to structural salience, I relate the attested diachronic asymmetry to structural differences across deictic classes: specifically, I argue that person features are only salient, and therefore stable, in personal pronouns and in the indexical part of possessives, but that they are not salient, and therefore unstable, in the indexical part of demonstratives.",0
"This article presents a formal analysis of Kosraean iterative reduplication in a serial templatic approach. The analysis shows that the variable monosyllabic reduplicant starts as a syllable template, which may ultimately surface as CV, VC, or CVC, as a result from the interaction between the constraints banning sequences of identical elements, and the general phonology of the language. Therefore, for the (C)VC variant no heaviness condition on the reduplicant is required.",0
"Agreement with coordination has been a topic of much discussion in the syntactic literature for decades. This is due to its significance in deepening our understanding of key issues, such as the way primitive syntactic operations such as Merge and Agree operate and interact with hierarchical/linear distance, the location of agreement in the grammar, and whether or not narrow syntax, just like the PF, has access to linear order when valuing agreement. This paper empirically and theoretically contributes to the growing body of literature on the topic by investigating agreement with preverbal and sandwiched coordinate phrases in Jordanian Arabic. A special focus will be directed to furthest conjunct agreement, agreement with the first conjunct in preverbal position, since it challenges the mainstream generalization that conjunct agreement occurs with the closest conjunct. The paper reports on a series of four large-scale experiments on Jordanian Arabic and shows that agreement in these domains comes in various forms. Building on Citko (2018), I propose an analysis of the facts that overcomes the problems faced by previous work and that provides support to a new perspective on the computation of agreement, by distinguishing multiple simultaneous Agree that gives rise to resolved agreement from multiple nonsimultaneous Agree, where agreement may be distributed between narrow syntax and the PF.",0
"This thesis investigates how the knowledge of number is linguistically implemented, on the basis of a wide range of cross-linguistic data. In Chapter 2, I examine a number of properties of multiplicative complex cardinals like three hundred books. The starting point in the discussion in this chapter is recent work by Ionin and Matushansky (2006, 2018), who argue that in a multiplicative complex cardinal like ""three hundred"", the multiplier (""three"") and the multiplicand (""hundred"") have the same syntactic and semantic properties. I point out some problems for Ionin and Matushansky's (2018) analysis of multiplicative complex cardinals, and argue that multiplicands are syntactic heads used for measurement, whereas multipliers are phrasal constituents appearing in the specifier position of a phrase headed by the multiplicand. Chapter 3 investigates additive complex cardinals like ""twenty one books"". Ionin and Matushansky (2018) argue that additive complex cardinals generally involve a coordinate structure. In this regard, I argue that there are two types of coordination structure for additive complex cardinals, building on Ionin and Matushansky's (2018) analysis of additive complex cardinals and the discussion in Chapter 2. I will also show that additive complex cardinals in some languages behave differently depending on the presence/absence of an overt coordinator. All the crosslinguistic data that will be discussed in Chapter 3 can be accounted for by assuming a non-coordinate structure of additive complex cardinals, in addition to the coordinate structure. Chapter 4 investigates the derivational patterns of ordinals like ""the seventh book"", on the basis of results of a broad cross-linguistic survey. Based on an examination of strategies of forming ordinals in both classifier and non-classifier languages, a common property of ordinals will be identified: ordinals behave like nominal expressions. I also examine possible and impossible constituent orders concerning ordinals, and show that ordinal markers display the same pattern as numeral classifiers regarding (im)possible constituent orders in combination with nouns and numerals. Building on this similarity, I propose that ordinal markers and numeral classifiers occur in the same position in the extended nominal projection. Chapter 5 examines linguistic expressions of fractions like ""two thirds of the book"". It will be shown that the numerator and the denominator can in""lude a covert/overt ""part"" noun in fractions on the basis of a cross-linguistic survey. I will show that the existence of the ""part"" element is not expected under Ionin and Matushansky's (2018) analysis of fractions and provide an alternative analysis for the syntax and semantics of fractions. Building on the proposed analysis, I will also argue that some languages allow for two types of structures of fractions: the left-branching structure and the cascading structure.",0

"This chapter provides a chronological overview of the treatment of degree morphology in the generative literature from the 1970s until today. Starting out from Ultan's (1972)  four basic degrees of comparison, it initially widens the scope to consider other types of degree morphology. It then hones in on the expression of the positive, comparative and superlative degrees, and the way these are related to one another. It is shown how the functional superstructure of the adjective became increasingly fine-grained, with the earliest proposals (Bresnan 1973, Corver 1997) involving a partitive layer (QP) with a degree determiner (DEG) on top of the lexical adjectival core. It is then shown how DEG is split  up into CMPR and SPRL in the work of Bobaljik (2012), which is based on attested and unattested patterns in root suppletion in the triplet positive-comparative-superlative. Nanosyntactic treatments are discussed, which decompose Bobaljik's heads even further, on the basis of evidence from Czech comparatives and Latin superlatives. Finally, the particular position of the positive degree is discussed, in particular its relation to the comparative, both with respect to their morphological marking and their underlying structural and semantic relationship.",0
"[FINAL VERSION of the position paper + RESPONSES TO THE RESPONSES] This paper claims that grammar change is a case of Darwinian evolution whenever a change shapes the cognitively encapsulated, procedural parts of grammar. The cognitively accessible, declarative content of grammars is open for socially motivated changes of the Lamarckian kind.  
The grammar of a language is a complex neuro-cognitively represented program. Such programs are results of an ongoing process of evolution, that is, results of the interplay between variation and selection, on the level of competing variants of these cognitive programs. In cognitive evolution, the same principles operate as in biological evolution, but the domains of biology and cognition are disjoint, of course. Evolution of grammar is not a facet of biological evolution. It is a domain of evolution on its own. However, as the very same general abstract principles are at work in each domain, the evolutionary processes are structurally identical. As a consequence, theoretical insights of a century of research in population genetics can be cautiously adduced and utilized for the explanation of grammar changes.",0
"I argue that patterns of case syncretism across languages can be modelled by partially, rather than totally, ordered case hierarchies. Partially ordered case hierarchies avoid the need for postulating multiple instances of the same case while retaining case contiguity in the representation of case syncretism. I discuss data from three languages in which differential object marking is syncretic with dative and show that partially ordered hierarchies capture these and other patterns of syncretism in line with some of the conclusions reached by Harðarson (2016) and Zompì (2019) about cross-linguistic patterns of case syncretism.",0

The OC is put to use to explain the limited extent to which a variety of expression types can occur in compounds; these include Tense, pronouns, contextually varying expressions like ""girlfriend"" and ""nearby"", quantificational expressions, ordinals, proper names, and indexicals like ""now"" and ""today"". The note concludes with a speculation about why OC holds where it does.",0
"This document is a compilation of weekly ""topic guides"" I wrote when teaching LING 100 Introduction to Linguistics in the 2020–2021 academic year at Queen's University, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a year-long introductory course that covers the main descriptive areas of language structure: morphology, syntax, semantics, phonetics, and phonology. In 2020-2021 it also included units on sociolinguistics, language acquisition (including language policy and revitalization), and language & music (the last not represented in the written topic guides). The weekly topic guides were written to accompany a series of content videos, which I have also made available online, as well as the open access textbook ""Essentials of Linguistics"" written by Catharine Anderson (https://essentialsoflinguistics.pressbooks.com/). 

Though the conditions under which this text was written means it doubtlessly contains many errors and omissions, I hope it and the accompanying videos may be useful to people teaching similar courses, whether in person or online.

"When a perfect verb is negated in Bengali, the special portmanteaux negator ni is used instead of the usual sentential negator na. However for speakers who permit ellipsis of the complement of negation, when a perfect verb is elided under sentential negation, the elsewhere negator na is the one that appears outside the ellipsis site. This paper argues that despite the absence of ni with ellipsis, all of the ingredients which normally require its presence exist in elliptical constructions. It argues that the alternation between na in most cases and ni in the perfect is best understood as the result of contextual allomorphy, which is bled by ellipsis. The analysis has consequences for proposed restrictions on directionality and locality of contextual allomorphy. In particular, inward-sensitive morphosyntactically conditioned allomorphy exists, and neither structural nor linear adjacency is required to trigger allomorphy.

"Linguistics is a relatively young field. The birth of a new, vibrant field of research often brings with it certain challenges such as the initial absence of an uncontroversial canon and a certain lack of terminological clarity. Following the example of closely allied disciplines, this work aims to register ambiguities in the use of ten terms in linguistics, with the overarching aim to aid field-internal coherence and field-external visibility. Among other issues, we discuss the influential 'three factors' model, labeling, reference, and E-/I-language. Addressing the challenge of looking back while moving forward, we compile a collection of definitions and/or presentations extracted from knowledge-rich contexts for each term, grounded in current usages. We first reflect on previous usages in order to present the first definitions of these terms and track terminological ambiguities that arose throughout their subsequent use. We then attempt to transition towards terminological clarity, providing specific recommendations for a more transparent use of these terms.",0
"Nominal concord is a phenomenon whereby nominal modifiers (e.g., adjectives, demonstratives, numerals) agree with their nominals along various dimensions (e.g., gender, number, case, definiteness). Here, drawing on a rich and typologically diverse database of nominal concord (Norris 2020), we build a Bayesian mixed effect model of nominal concord. Specifically, we consider two competing hypotheses regarding the statistical relationship between different types of concord within a language: (1) concord begets concord: the presence of some type of concord in a language makes it more likely that it has other types of concord vs. (2) a little concord goes a long way: if a language has some kind of concord, it is less likely to have other types of concord. We present evidence strongly in favor of the first hypothesis, that concord begets concord. Languages with nominal concord tend to have concord in more than one place and of more than one type. Using posterior draws from our model, we also provide quantitative evidence for a number of the tendencies described by Norris (2019a). Future work will build on this model to understand the functional role of nominal concord in language systems, how it evolves, and how it co-evolves with other typological features.",0
"We discuss cases of salvation and non-salvation by deletion in the domain of lexical gaps. We distinguish two types of defectiveness: (i) defectiveness that can be saved by PF-deletion, which we take result from the lack an eligible allomorph for certain environments within a language, and (ii) defectiveness that cannot be saved by PF-deletion, which we take to signal the lack of a proper alloseme for a given environment. With ellipsis modeled as an instruction for non-pronunciation on the PF-branch, only gaps on the Exponent List can be saved by it.",0
"This paper describes the gender system of Laal, a language isolate of Chad. Laal has a strictly semantic, partly sex-based gender system making use of three semantic features: [±human], [masculine/feminine], and [±abstract], defining four genders: human masculine, human feminine, neuter, and abstract. Gender is covert on nouns; it is marked only on agreeing pronouns and functional words. The morphological marking and structure of the gender system is different in pronouns and functional words. Seven agreement classes are defined by various conflations of gender and number categories in both pronominal forms and functional words.",0
"This revision of a PowerPoint presentation from a University of British Columbia talk on 4 March 2021 outlines how a phonologically driven theory of grammar (Schmerling 2018) explains apparent misalignments of syntactic
and prosodic structures as resulting from operations that substitute units of varying weight at prosodic edges and that apply bottom to top in the formation of larger structures. On this approach, syntax is semantically relevant relations among prosodic structures. This theory is a generalization to units larger than prosodic words of the item and process morphology of Edward Sapir and his students. A Sapirian perspective on the relationship between grammar and phonology allows us to view ""bracketing paradoxes"" identified to date as
involving affixations, i.e., operations that increment prosodic words within prosodic phrases. A broader perspective on the sound grammar relationship, however, lets us see affixations as akin to substitutions of units smaller than words, like the mutations of Celtic initial consonants or of syllable nuclei as in Germanic umlaut and Indo European and Penutian ablaut. Formation operations that apply directly to prosodic structures further allow us to revise our conception of the motivation for syntactic categories, which can now be divorced from units properly seen as prosodic and which are thus applicable to languages traditionally seen as typologically incommensurate. A further advantage of this approach to linguistic structure is its ability to explain lexicalization of linguistic expressions as simply entailing a prosodic structure (initially) ceasing to be derived according to
some formation rule.",0
"On the basis of original data from Moksha Mordvin (Finno-Ugric), I argue that some languages have nominal concord even though modifiers of the noun generally do not show inflection. Evidence for the presence of concord comes from nominal ellipsis, under which inflection is phonologically realized and restricted in the same way as regular nominal concord. To account for the distribution of concord exponents, I develop a model that allows features to be present in syntax but avoid realization. In particular, I propose that (i) Spell-Out applies to a node as soon as its Merge and Agree features are satisfied; (ii) Agree features are by default ineligible at PF and need to undergo Probe Conversion in order to get accessible to PF processes. The distribution of features then follows from the respective timing of Spell-Out and Probe Conversion.",0
"Myler (2017) proposes an algorithm for root-outward cyclic Spell-Out (Bobaljik, 2000) where the order in which heads are spelled out may deviate from their linear order when phrasal movement within the phonological word causes a mismatch between this linear order and the syntactic hierarchy (so-called Mirror Principle violations). Myler uses this method to account for cases where a morphophonological process applies across an intervening morpheme. I extend his model to morphosyntactically conditioned contextual allomorphy in Hungarian possessive DPs. Myler's algorithm allows us to preserve strict locality, where only adjacent morphosyntactic nodes may condition contextual allomorphy (Embick, 2010).",0
"This paper explores the realization of definiteness in Chuj, an underdocumented Mayan language. I show that Chuj provides support for recent theories that distinguish between weak and strong definite descriptions (e.g. Schwarz 2009, 2013; Arkoh and Matthewson 2013; Hanink 2018; Jenks 2018). A set of morphemes called ""noun classifiers"" contribute a uniqueness presupposition, composing directly with nominals to form weak definites. To form strong definites, I show that two pieces are required: (i) the noun classifier, which again contributes a uniqueness presupposition, and (ii) extra morphology that contributes an anaphoricity presupposition. Chuj strong definites thus provide explicit evidence for a decompositional account of weak and strong definites, as also advocated in Hanink 2018. I then extend this analysis to third person pronouns, which are realized in Chuj with bare classifiers, and which I propose come in two guises depending on their use. On the one hand, based on previous work (Postal 1966, Cooper 1979, Heim 1990), I argue that classifier pronouns can sometimes be E-type pronouns: weak definite determiners which combine with a covert index-introducing predicate. In such cases, classifier pronouns represent a strong definite description. On the other hand, I argue based on diagnostics established in Bi and Jenks 2019, that Chuj classifier pronouns sometimes arise as a result of NP ellipsis (Elbourne 2001, 2005). In such cases, classifier pronouns reflect a weak definite description.",0
"Drawing on data from three typologically different languages, this paper investigates the semantic function of numeral classifiers. In the literature, there are two main families of proposals for numeral classifiers. The first argues that classifiers are needed for numerals: the classifier first combines with the numeral before combining with the noun (e.g. Krifka 1995, Bale & Coon 2014, Bale et al. 2019), which we call classifier-for-numeral theories. This
contrasts with the set of theories that argues that classifiers are needed for nouns, meaning that the classifier combines with the noun before combining with the numeral (e.g Chierchia 1998, Cheng & Sybesma 1999), which we call classifier-for-noun theories. Here, we investigate predictions of both families of theories and provide evidence that both are correct, but for different languages.",0
"In this paper, we provide one of the first descriptions of associated motion in a Papuan language. Ende, a language of southern Papua New Guinea, has one directional affix that codes path towards the deictic centre when combined with verbs of motion or transfer. When this affix is combined with other verbs, it gives rise to interpretations of an associated, secondary motion event. This type of ""deictic associated motion"" was first explicitly described by Belkadi (2015) in several languages of Africa. Ende's deictic associated motion system is unlike prototypical associated motion systems, such as that in Kaytetye (Pama-Nyungan, Australia), in that Ende does not have dedicated affixes that code associated
motion. Instead, Ende's associated motion expression relies on inference on the art of speakers and hearers to give rise to the motion readings. Accordingly, we propose the terms dedicated associated motion and inferential associated motion to distinguish these two very different associated motion systems, one of which relies on dedicated affixes or other structures, and the other, which relies on speakers' and hearers' inferences.",0
"A revised and expanded version of this paper will appear in Word Structure 15.1 (Spring 2022). For a link to the accepted manuscript, see the author's home page (www.f.waseda.jp/dechene). It is proposed that the alternations ā ～ a and a ～ Ø in the stem-final syllable of Sanskrit nominals such as rā́jān- 'king' and dātār- 'giver' are due to rules of shortening and syncope. If so, those alternations provide no support, contrary to claims in the literature, for a framework in which stem alternants are associated with ""morphomic indices"" by stem-indexing rules and, more generally, no support for a morphomic or purely morphological level of representation mediating between morphosyntax and morphophonology.",0
"This paper revisits clausal possession in Isbukun Bunun, which involves two distinct structures with one single thematic interpretation. It shows that, although thematically identical, the two distinct structures are not derived via agreement/movement from a single underlying structure. To best capture the (morpho)syntactic patterns within and beyond the phenomenon, the too-many-structures problem is best analyzed as involving distinct underlying structures with expletive heads (Schäfer 2008, Wood 2015, Kastner 2016) and delayed saturation (Marantz 2013, Wood 2015, Myler 2016, Wood & Marantz 2017, Kastner 2020, Tyler 2020, inter alia) of thematic relations at work at the (morpho)syntax-semantics interface. The proposed analysis not only stands with Zeitoun's (2000) claim that the morpheme -an in clausal possession is a locative voice marker, but also supports Myler's (2016) theory of clausal possession and Nie's (2019, 2020) proposal for the morphosyntax of Austronesian argument structure. Most importantly, as corroborated by clausal possession (Isbukun Bunun), possessor raising (Tagalog and Taoshang Atayal), and restructuring (Mayrinax Atayal), this paper shows that expletive heads and delayed saturation play integral roles in the (morpho)syntax-semantics of Austronesian languages.",1
"Monosyllabic reduplicative affixation in Mbe, where the amount of material copied is predetermined by a subsequent phonological change, presents for the serial templatic approach to reduplication a lookahead problem that the parallel counterpart can successfully capture with global evaluation of phonotactic constraints (Wei & Walker 2020). I propose, however, that serial reduplication in Kavalan and Ilokano suggests that the lookahead effect is epiphenomenal and derivable if foot binarity is respected at the moraic level. Therefore, the prima facie lookahead in Mbe might no longer be probative in the assessment of the parallel versus serial theory of reduplication.",0
"In this paper I present an analysis of the verb second phenomenon in German. I suggest, along the lines of Desouvrey (2020), that tensed verbs must cliticize to the highest host in order to break free from an inseparable ill-morpheme. They become, thus, live vectors and take their widest scope in the structure. I argue that the ill-morpheme that plagues the German conjugation system is ge, which surfaces only in past participle verbs by a default morphological rule associating the floating melody with the skeleton. In complement clauses, many complexities arise because the relative complementizer is a vector. If both verbs move, the resulting structure amounts to a parallelogram of forces by virtue of which the two most distant vectors become the resultant of all the intermediate ones, which are therefore bypassed, i.e. they are not spelled out. In most cases, the bypassed element is the complementizer, hence its  complementarity with V2. I assemble evidence from relative clauses, wh-extraction, and multiple questions, showing that the bypass effect can eliminate significant material as well, including negation, wh-interrogatives, and relative pronouns. It turns out that a mathematical tool which is useful in the physical world takes center stage in German syntax.",0
"We analyze sibilant harmony in the Santiago Atitlán dialect of Tz'utujil (Mayan), a phenomenon that was briefly described by Dayley (1985). Novel data show that the obligatory harmony process (i) is asymmetrical (triggered only by [+ant] sibilants), (ii) progressive, and (iii) applies long-distance. Furthermore, we argue that the process is not stem-controlled. In contextualizing the phenomenon within the typology of sibilant harmony (Hansson 2010), we conclude that it is unique. Finally, we suggest that Santiago Tz'utujil sibilant harmony has been stable diachronically because the target segment /ʃ/ is always in the stressed syllable, thus being salient in the input during acquisition.",0
"This chapter describes the main linguistic features of three South-American dialects: Chile Spanish, Río de la Plata Spanish and Paraguay Spanish. Assuming Kayne's conjecture that all relevant linguistic variation, in particular syntactic variation, can be reduced to microparameters, i.e., to a subset of properties present in a subset of functional items, we dismiss the distinction between Spanish and its dialects, and adopt the equation: ""dialect = language"". Then, we introduce some historical and geographical background in order to set the ulterior description, which is essentially
an overview of the main lexical, phonological/phonetic, morphological and syntactic particularities of the three dialects/languages. Yet, the description is intentionally not balanced, since we particularly focused on certain syntactic features of these dialects that clearly illustrate what Kayne's conjecture is about. So the chapter is offered, first , as a basic overview of the dialects under consideration and, second, as a gateway, or just an invitation, for further inquiry on dialectal variation from a microparametric perspective.",0
"This is an invited comment on Martin Haspelmath's target article 'General linguistics must be based on universals (or nonconventional aspects of language)', highlighting some of the pros and cons of his metatheoretical ideas. After acknowledging H's merits in typology and universals research I focus on attacking the unnessessarily overstressed dichotomies he advocates between description and comparison, particular languages and language in general, and particular and general linguistics, that amount to erecting an unhelpful wall. Using arguments from philosopy of science some terminological, methodological, and ontological shortcomings are pointed out.",0
"In this chapter, we highlight some potential challenges for the strongest possible version of dependent case theory which implies that Agree never mediates case assignment. The challenges come from contexts where non-DPs which are not case undergoes nonetheless function as case competitors and where the computation of case depends not only on the presence of another DP but on the comparison of the finer phi-features of two DPs (global case splits). In both contexts, we propose, an account based on Cyclic Agree fares better than the dependent case approach.",0
"It is often assumed that the morphophonological derivation of a word is isomorphic to its surface morphotactics and to its abstract morphosemantic structure. On the surface, passive verbs in Armenian provide a counter-example to this assumption. At first glance, the surface exponents of passive verbs seem to depend on the root. In contrast, the morphophonology of the passive depends on the stem of active verbs, not the root. This complex dependency can be easily handled with Output-Output constraints over bound stems (Steriade 2016). Such an analysis is pseudo-cyclic. However, upon closer examination at the morphosemantic dependencies of passives and actives, I ultimately argue that the pseudo-cyclicity is only apparent. I explicitly argue that the stem of active verbs are cyclically contained within passive verbs. In order to explain why the theme vowel of the active stem is absent in the passive, I utilize affix truncation rules from Aronoff (1976), roughly equivalent to contemporary DM's readjustment rules (Trommer 2012b). Data from allosemy and dialectal variation further reinforce the cyclic dependency of passives over actives.",0
"This paper is a slightly modified introduction to my cumulative habilitation thesis (Studies in information structure and reference), submitted for consideration at the Charles University in Prague. It contains a survey of the core notions of information structure and reference (as used in the formal approaches to syntax and semantics), of how these notions have developed and how they relate to others - both terminologically and conceptually. It also provides an overview of the existing theories of the IS-syntax and IS-semantics interfaces.",0
"This paper aims to unravel the syntax of Serbo-Croatian clitics, which tend to cluster in the second position of the sentence (Wackernagel's Law). It is shown that this phenomenon rises from a morphological peculiarity of the auxiliary verbs in that their conjugation consists of a compound of two morphemes, one of which shows a floating melody, i.e. not associated to the skeleton. Then either a default rule associating the melody to the skeleton takes place in the morphology, in which case the full form surfaces, or else the auxiliary compound enters the syntax, where the floating melody must be eliminated. This is realized by the mandatory adjunction of the auxiliary to a suitable element. By virtue of the temporal adjunction, the deficient morpheme, which is not in the path of the linearization process, is filtered out as stray. As a result, one morpheme surfaces as a clitic. This analysis obviously predicts that both the third person clitic je, and the reflexive se, which carry the deficient morpheme on their right side (jeste, sebe) must postpone their placement at the end of the cluster, for whatever material adjoined to them will anchor to the stray morpheme and will disappear with it at the end of the derivation. This morphological peculiarity, together with the widespread specification of the feature ω (which may induce a superiority effect) in various paradigms, accounts for the complexities observed in this language. SC offers a new insight on the role of the adjunction and the subsequent linearization process, which turns out to be much more than a simple pronunciation protocol between the grammar and the oral modality.",0
"This paper argues that recent proposals to sharply distinguish between language description and comparison are ill-conceived for two reasons. First, comparison is unavoidable and hence an integral part of description. Second, the proposals for a strict separation are based on an unrealistic and anachronistic conception of descriptive categories, assuming that these can be defined in purely distributional terms. Here it is shown that description and comparison make use of, and struggle with, the same kind of empirical evidence; namely, crosslinguistically identifiable properties of grammatical formatives and constructions. If descriptive categories and crosslinguistic comparative concepts did not share such properties, language comparison would be devoid of empirical content. Hence claims that they are ontologically different do not stand up to further scrutiny. In short, said recent proposals portray language description and comparison in too-simplistic terms. They ignore, or at least downplay, most of the complexities involved in both descriptive and comparative projects, many of which in fact result from the inseparability of description and comparison.",0
"Kalin (2020b), building on Kalin (2019, 2020a) and Kalin & Rolle (2020) has defended a strong model of the architecture of word-formation concerning infixation and suppletion, in relation to linearization and phonology. Among others this model makes the following two claims. First that the conditions for selecting an allomorph over another and the conditions for selecting its position if it is an infix, are separate and irreconcilable. And second that allomorph sets share an edge orientation: left-edge infix allomorphs only alternate with prefixes and right-edge infix allomorphs only with suffixes. I will argue that the first point is unsupported by the typological data covered by Kalin & Rolle and that the latter is directly falsified by the agreement affixes of Sáliba, a language of Colombia.",0
"This paper is a commentary on Haspelmath's ""General Linguistics must be
based on Language Universals"". Some practitioners in the natural-kinds programme
argue that theoretical models developed and fit to data of one language
make testable predictions about the next. I argue that this is not obviously true in cases where categories and relations presupposed by the hypothesis do not map deterministically onto the next language. While such a theoretical model can be fit, hypotheses couched in the model cannot be meaningfully tested. While I agree
with Haspelmath's paper in general, I suggest that the distinction between the
Boasian/Greenbergian and natural-kinds programme may describe a normative
tendency rather than a necessary division in the field.",0
"A synthetic compound is regarded as an endocentric construction in which a deverbal nominal head inherits the internal argument of the underlying verb. The Akan noun-verb nominal compound is analysed as a synthetic noun-noun compound with a deverbal right-hand constituent. This is based on a pattern of downstep observed on the first syllable of the second constituent, triggered by a putative floating low tone of a deleted nominal(izing) prefix. This approach, which makes the compound endocentric, is needed to account for the nominal syntactic category of the compound, given that the left-hand nominal constituent is not the head. In this paper, we discuss and reject this endocentric analysis, showing that the argument for the nominal status of the right-hand constituent based on tonal melody alone is weak because some constructs which meet the structural requirement fail to exhibit the specified tonal melody. We argue, however, that we can maintain the synthetic compound analysis without committing to defend the view that the right-hand constituent is nominalized. This is the exocentric synthetic compound view. We present a constructionist account in which the syntactic category is a holistic constructional property of the compound, which is inherited from a meta-schema for Akan compounding. We also present a preliminary constructionist account of the tonal melody of the compound.",1
"Morphological agreement with coordinate phrases involves a computation that takes as its input a set of features from each conjunct and outputs exactly one resolved set of features (number, person, grammatical gender oun class, commonly labelled phi-features). Such resolution is typically taken to be grammar-internal because it relies on other grammar-internal ingredients (phi-features, agreement, coordination), and at least in some instances seems to follow systematic rules that may be captured by familiar grammatical operations. Exceptions to these apparent rules, if not ignored altogether, have received disparate analyses depending on the language, framework, and the particular features involved. In this thesis, I argue that it is such exceptions that are illuminating, and that the appearance of rigid rules is misleading. Treating variation in agreement with coordinate phrases as exceptional with respect to the otherwise deterministic output rules either delays the task of explaining the surface data, or risks weakening the language competence theory by adding the baroque stipulations that a purely grammar-internal treatment would require. Phi-agreement with coordinate phrases is subject to inter- and intra-speaker variability and ineffability; such variation is widespread in the world's languages, even the ones with limited phi-agreement morphology like English. I therefore reject the grammar-internal approach to agreement with coordinate phrases and argue instead that the agreement morphology we observe on the surface is due to grammar-external mechanisms being recruited to determine the resulting agreement morphology. Under this approach, systematicity in agreement with coordinations is only apparent and can be manipulated. The reason a grammar-internal mechanism is unavailable is because it would have to take place on the agreeing head (e.g., Infl0 or v0), and what we know about agreement between a syntactic head and multiple arguments (e.g., from omnivorous agreement and the Person Case Constraint) renders it ill-suited for the task of coordination resolution.",0
"Two levels of ontology are commonly distinguished in philosophy: the ontology of ordinary objects and the ontology of what there really or fundamentally is. This papers argues that natural language reflects not only the ontology of ordinary objects, but also a language-driven ontology, which is involved in the mass-count distinction and part-structure-sensitive semantic selection (as well as perhaps the light ontology of pleonastic entities in the sense of Schiffer). The language-driven ontology does not constitute another level of representation, but is taken to be a (selective) ontology of the real, given a plenitudinous or maximalist conception of reality, which has been advocated by a number of philosophers. The language-driven ontology aligns closely with the functional part of grammar and a commitment to it is mandatory with the use of language. This gives rise to a novel view according to which part of ontology (ontology of the real) should be considered part of universal grammar on a broadened understanding.
     The paper recasts my older theory of situated part structures without situations, in purely ontological terms, making use of a primitive notion of unity.",0
"A revised and expanded version of this paper will appear in Journal of Japanese Linguistics 38.2 (Fall 2022). For a link to the accepted manuscript, see the author's home page (www.f.waseda.jp/dechene).

In addition to the syntactic (inflectional) causative suffix -(s)ase-, Japanese displays a lexical (derivational) causative suffix -(a)se- (aw-ase- 'join', no-se- 'place on') whose a-zero alternation is general in the stem-level phonology. Because the UR of syntactic -(s)ase- must include the s of its postvocalic alternant, the two suffixes necessarily have distinct phonological forms; there is thus no way to treat them as ""high attachment"" and ""low attachment"" versions of a single element. The division of labor between syntactic -(s)ase- and lexical -(a)se- invites the conclusion that no causative suffix is syntactic in some cases and lexical in others; if so, causatives pose no challenge to the position that while Japanese inflectional morphology is the phonological realization of syntactic representations, derivational morphology involves lexical listing of stems. The conclusion that there is no causative suffix that spans the syntactic/lexical boundary is validated by showing that forms that have been taken in the literature as exemplifying lexical -(s)ase- are in fact either lexical -(a)se- or syntactic -(s)ase-. As part of this demonstration, it is shown that, with minor exceptions, verb stems in -ase- have arisen as variants of pre-existing stems in -as-, and an explanation for this ongoing process of replacement is proposed.",0
"This squib raises three matters: first, it discusses the conditions under which it is necessary to posit gender features, as opposed to gender being a facet of 'lexical' / encyclopaedic content. Second, it looks into how we can use gender features to describe the cross-linguistic generalisation that there exist no completely arbitrary gender systems, by appealing to their structural positions and their interpretability. Finally, it brings to focus evidence from Modern Greek suggesting that exponent insertion of nouns factors in semantic gender, albeit not in an always successful way.",0

"[Note: This paper has been heavily revised from the original version; comments very welcome!]. This paper explores patterns of agreement and word order in the Central Algonquian language Border Lakes Ojibwe. This variety of Ojibwe shows alternations between VOS and VSO word orders and complex interactions between probes on v, Voice, Infl, and C. I show that the behavior of lower probes feeds and bleeds the possible feature copying and movement relations on each subsequent probe. There are three major components to the analysis: (i) post-syntactic verb raising to C, deriving V1 and the complex verbal morphophonology; (ii) an extension of the interaction/satisfaction representation of Deal (2015, 2020) to encode a ""relativized EPP"" that captures variation and restrictions on movement and the possibility of movement and feature copying being independent, and (iii) a reformulation of the Activity Condition (Chomsky 2000, 2001) to capture ""reverse omnivority"", where a probe agrees with lower ranked arguments over higher ranked arguments regardless of whether it is a subject or object. The account provides a strong case for Ojibwe as a configurational language, and is shown to capture variation in agreement and word order in the Algonquian family and beyond.",0
"Children's differing learning trajectories cross-linguistically have been at the forefront of gender acquisition research, often with conflicting results and conclusions. As a result, the source of children's different learning behaviors in gender acquisition has been unclear. I argue that children's gender acquisition is driven by the search for productive patterns. First, I provide corpus studies where the predictions of a learning model (Yang, 2016) are formulated. Second, I report the results of an elicited production task on Icelandic-speaking children (N = 26, ages 2;6-6;3 years) and adults (N = 18) that puts these predictions to test. The results suggest that Icelandic-speaking children and adults draw a categorical distinction between productive and unproductive suffixes in Icelandic gender assignment. I discuss the implications of these findings for morphological learning beyond gender acquisition.",0
"Nouns in Nuer (Western Nilotic) nouns have been presented as an extreme example of inflectional complexity, where a 'chaotic' distribution of suffixes combines with dozens of different stem modifications to yield dozens of inflection classes,  (Frank 1999, Baerman 2012). We show that all of the apparent surface variety can be reduced a handful of operations. The proliferation of inflection classes is due to a property we call PARADIGMATIC SATURATION: practically every combination of inflectional operations is attested, yielding the maximum variety with the minimum of means.",0
"Argument coding splits such as split (= differential) object marking and split ergative marking have long been known to represent universal tendencies, but the generalizations have not been formulated in their full generality before. In particular, ditransitive constructions have rarely been taken into account, and scenario splits have often been treated separately. Here I argue that all these patterns can be understood in terms of the usual association of role rank (highly ranked A and R, low-ranked P and T) and referential prominence (locuphoric person, animacy, specificity, etc.). At the most general level, the role-reference association universal says that deviations from usual associations of role rank and referential prominence tend to be coded by longer grammatical forms. In other words, A and R tend to be referentially prominent in language use, while P and T are less prominent, and when less usual associations need to be expressed, languages often require special coding by means of additional flags (case- markers and adpositions) or additional verb coding (e.g. inverse or passive markers). I argue that role-reference association is an instance of the even more general pattern of form-frequency correspondence, and that the coding asymmetries can all be explained by frequency-based predictability and coding efficiency.",1
"The class of adverbs contains a large number of subcategories, ranging from adverbs of manner and degree to modal and illocutionary adverbs. What all adverbs have in common is that they modify a non-nominal head. This head may be lexical in nature, such as an adjective modified by a degree adverb, or syntactic, such as a full clause modified by an evidential adverb. In this chapter, adverbs are classified in terms of the types of head they modify, which will lead to a systematic classification of adverb classes that have been identified individually in the literature. It is furthermore shown that this classification provides the basis for a series of generalizations concerning the form and behaviour of classes of adverbs. These generalizations are formulated using the theoretical framework of Functional Discourse Grammar.",0
"We demonstrate the existence of a novel type of morphomic structure: the
suffix combination in word formation. We ran two psycholinguistic
experiments with 45 native and 30 non-native English speakers, asking them
to judge whether or not existing and non-existing two-suffix combinations
presented without bases occur in English. Both groups identified existing and
non-existing suffix combinations with very high accuracy; productive
combinations were recognized more accurately than unproductive ones. Our
research shows that suffix combinations are listed in the mental lexicon as
morphomes. This finding accords with recent research in natural language
processing that induces a language's patterns, rules, and semantics based
entirely on form relations. We also discuss other possible applications of the
morphome outside of theoretical linguistics.",0
"In this paper, we discuss the relationship between syntax and morphology. In particular, we are interested in the question of the extent to which morphological generalizations can be accounted for in terms of syntactic operations and principles. The thesis that will be defended is the following:
Morphological generalizations are accounted for in terms of syntactic operations and principles. There is no morphological component in UG. There are no post-syntactic morphological operations.",0
"[THIS IS THE PUBLISHED .pdf-VERSION]. Grammars are decomposable. On the one hand, an adequate characterization of a given utterance factorizes the contributions of each subsystem of grammar and on the other hand, it thereby reduces the apparent overall complexity to the interaction of less complex subsystems. Scrambling is an apt showcase. Its complicated properties are not inherent properties of a syntactic construction but the result of the interaction of phrase structuring with other subsystems of grammar, and in particular with the information-structuring (IS) subsystem of pragmatics. Scrambling is 'utilized' rather than 'triggered'. In general, when syntax admits structural variation, this potential is captured and utilized by other subsystems of grammar. 

Germanic and Slavic languages are handy testimonies for rejecting syntactic trigger scenarios not only for scrambling but also for other constructions with displaced items. Cross-linguistically, Scrambling is not a matter of syntactical determinism. For an adequate syntactical account of Scrambling it is sufficient to understand and explain the structural conditions that make a language a scrambling language. The pragmatic functions that utilize scrambling structures are not a concern of syntax. They are syntactically not causal and epiphenomenal to syntax.",1
"This dissertation explores the argument structure of various verb classes through the lens of sub-lexical modification and the presuppositions introduced by 'again'. Chapter 1 lays out the assumptions of a constructionist, decompositional view of argument structure, how semantic interpretation proceeds in this view, and a structural analysis of 'again'-ambiguities. Chapter 2 explores repetitive presuppositions introduced by 'again' which exclude the agent external argument. Theories that sever the external argument and agent entailments like intentionality from the verb and introduce them through functional heads in the syntax predict that such presuppositions should always be allowed. Verbs like 'kill' bear this out; when modified by 'again', 'kill' allows contexts where the prior event need not contain the same agent nor require the event to be intentionally carried out. However, verbs like 'murder' disallow such contexts; rather, the prior event satisfying the presupposition of 'again' must always be an intentionally carried out event by the same agent. This contrast is unexpected in light of these theories. I develop a compositional analysis couched in DM where roots can contain representations of the external argument and agent entailments like intentionality. I further explore verbs of manner of forced taking like 'snatch', which allow subjectless presuppositions but require intentionally carried out prior events with 'again'. They hence show that agent entailments like intentionality and the agent argument can be dissociated in terms of where they are introduced. I then discuss the consequences of the analysis for theories of verb meaning that seek to constrain the range of entailments verbs can have by assuming a division of labor between structurally-introduced and root-introduced meaning entailments. Chapter 3 explores restitutive presuppositions produced by 'again' with change-of-state verbs like 'open'. The central observation is that when the holder argument that undergoes the change-of-state is quantificational like an indefinite, two kinds of restitutive presuppositions are produced in the transitive causative variant: one where in the prior event the holder argument is the same entity as the asserted event, and one where the two holder arguments are different. Crucially, this ambiguity is not observed with the intransitive inchoative variant; the holder argument must be the same entity across presupposition and assertion. Traditional decompositional theories of this verb class suggesting that there is a common small clause result state constituent in both the transitive and intransitive variants face difficulties in explaining such readings. Instead, I argue for an analysis where the causative and inchoative variants of change-of-state verbs have differing amounts of functional structure within the result state constituent to account for the difference in the range of restitutive presuppositions available. I further investigate the implications of indefinite holder arguments with change-of-state verbs modified by 'again' for analyses of 're'-prefixation, the representation of the counterdirectional requirement of 'again', and for scalar, degree-based analyses of degree achievements. Chapter 4 points out larger theoretical implications of this work, outlines possibilities for similar kinds of investigations in other languages, and concludes.",0
"In this paper, we trace the evolution from February to June 2020 of the gender of the noun ""COVID-19"" in French with respect to two databases: first, a Twitter database of nearly 78,000 tweets and second, a database of traditional media of approximately 500,000 articles. Each database considers only gender-marked instances of the term ""COVID-19,"" and our corpora are tagged for geographical origin in order to compare and contrast varieties of French as spoken in three continents, namely Africa, (North) America and Europe. We find that American media comply categorically and immediately with the recommendations of the feminine by the World Health Organization and various local (Canadian) linguistic authorities in early March 2020. More than 50% of tweets in the American data follow suit soon after. African media is similar in that a large number of articles and tweets adopt the feminine, but only coinciding with the recommendation of the feminine by the Académie Française in early May 2020. Finally, we find negligible use of the feminine in the European data. We argue that several factors are likely at play in these results, namely, dialect-specific tendencies in loanword adaptation and the French gender system, the relationship between linguistic authorities and local media, public attitudes towards linguistic authority and the relative time of the recommendations made by these linguistic authorities.",1
"Although Haspelmath's target article does not explicitly say it, the conception of languages (and of linguistics as a science) that the author presents is the same as the one found in Saussure's Course de linguistique générale (Saussure 1916): Languages are social constructs and linguistics is a social science. This view is not demonstrably wrong in and of itself, but I do believe that it is an incomplete and insufficient foundation on which to build a comprehensive science of language.",0
"This paper investigates reduplication in Kodi, an under-documented and understudied language spoken in Sumba Island, Nusa Tenggara Timur Province, eastern Indonesia. It is argued that (i) stress determines the reduplication process in Kodi in that the syllable or foot which is reduplicated is predictable from the stress patterns, (ii) semantic context triggers reduplication processes, and (iii) the framework of the theory of (Generalized) Paradigm Function Morphology ((G)PFM) (Stump, 2001, 2015; Steward & Stump, 2007; Spencer & Stump, 2013; Spencer, 2013; Nikolaeva & Spencer, 2019) can satisfactorily capture how stress determines the reduplication of the base and how semantic context triggers the reduplication process. This study provides additional evidence in support of the (G)PFM theory, which can arguably be extended to handle complex reduplicative patterns beyond Kodi.",0
"Morphological processes are generally computable with 1-way finite-state transducers. However, we show that 1-way transducers do not capture the strong generative capacity of certain morphological analyses for more complex processes, including mobile affixation, infixation, and partial reduplication. As diagnostics for strong generative capacity, we use origin semantics and order-preservation. These analyze the input-output correspondences generated by FSTs and their corresponding logical transductions. For some linguistic analyses of these complex processes, their strong generative capacity is matched by more expressive grammars, such as non-order-preserving transductions and their corresponding 2-way finite-state transducers.",0
"This paper proposes definitions of three terms that can potentially be used in answering key questions of general morphology and syntax: bound form, welded form, and affix. The term affix is sometimes thought to be involve phonological ""fusion"" of some kind, but I propose that it is best defined as a bound non-root that occurs on roots of different classes. A bound form (or non-autonomous form) is generally defined as a form that does not occur on its own, i.e. its definition makes no reference to phonology. As a term for a form that shows phonological interactions with its host, I propose the new term welded form. I discuss the ways in which these terms may (or may not) help us justify the syntax-morphology subdivision, and the ways in which these terms may perhaps be the basis for justifying speculative classifications such as the well-known isolating, agglutinative and flective types.",0
"The current paper aims to capture the properties of reduplication within the distributed morphology model (Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994; Embick and Noyer 2006; Siddiqi 2009; Embick 2010). Taking Standard Arabic (SA) as a representative, the article shows that SA, like many other languages, has both full and partial reduplication. Full reduplication repeats entire words or stems whereas partial reduplication doubles part of the stem. Rather than the available two analyses, i.e. the readjustment approach (Raimy 2000; Frampton 2009) and the affixation approach (Haugen 2008; Haugen and Harley 2010; Haugen 2011), the current paper provides a novel approach to the phenomenon of reduplication in the world languages. It argues that root consonants and vowels should be decomposed into non-phonetic distinctive features that undergo late insertion at PF. These non-phonetic distinctive features are supplied with sound items at PF in the same fashion that the terminal nodes with morphosyntactic features are fed with vocabulary items. This approach serves three purposes. It accounts for speech errors, captures the non-concatenative morphology in Semitic languages, and allows the reduplicant form to copy all the distinctive features of the roots, yielding instances of full reduplication. Instances of partial reduplication can be generated by root-sensitive impoverishment rules which target and delete some of the features of the stem or the reduplicant form.",1
"Much recent work has linked Kratzerian Voice to a typologically unusual four-way voice system found in Western Austronesian. For these researchers, Voice, together with two flavors of applicative heads, enable a wide range of phrases to be promoted to the phase edge of VoiceP and check structural case with T, giving rise to a cross-linguistically rare four-way voice system (e.g. Maclachlan 1996; Aldridge 2004, 2012, 2017; see also Rackowski 2002 and Rackowski & Richards 2005 for a similar approach). In this view, Austronesian-type voice is essentially similar to the active/passive alternation, with Voice being the core semi-functional head behind both types of systems.

In this paper, we argue instead that Austronesian-type voice is fundamentally different from Kratzerian Voice. Support for this claim comes from new data from Puyuma, an understudied Western Austronesian language that displays both an Austronesian-type four-way voice distinction and a two-way voice contrast akin to the Indo-European-style active/passive alternation. We show that these two voice types can co-occur in a single language because each is hosted in a distinct functional projection (the latter within VoiceP; the former in the C domain). We argue accordingly what has been termed 'voice' in the literature does not form a homogeneous group.",0
"A central question in Austronesian syntax concerns a typologically peculiar four-way voice system found in Tagalog and similar languages, where a change in verbal morphology correlates with a distinct argument-marking pattern and A-bar extraction restrictions. Under the traditional view, voice alternation in these languages correlates with a change in argument structure, enabling phrases of different types to move to the edge of VoiceP and participate in A-bar extraction.
In this paper, I demonstrate instead that voice alternation in Tagalog has no correlation with argument structure alternation, but indexes a change in topic selection. Support for this claim comes from novel binding evidence from Tagalog's three-place constructions, which shows that Tagalog's four-way voice morphology is best analyzed as the spell-out of four different bundles of abstract Agree relations that target the topic (i.e. pivot-marked phrase) of a clause, rather than case agreement or valency-indicating morphology hosted within VoiceP.",1
"This paper claims that a wide variety of grammatical coding asymmetries can be explained as adaptations to the language users' needs, in terms of frequency of use, predictability and coding efficiency. I claim that all grammatical oppositions involving a minimal meaning difference and a significant frequency difference are reflected in a universal coding asymmetry, i.e. a cross-linguistic pattern in which the less frequent member of the opposition gets special coding, unless the coding is uniformly explicit or uniformly zero. I give 25 examples of pairs of construction types, from a substantial range of grammatical patterns. For some of them, the existing evidence from the world's languages and from corpus counts is already strong, while for others, I know of no counterevidence and I make readily testable claims. I also discuss how the functional-adaptive forces operate in language change, and I discuss a number of possible alternative explanations.",0
"It has been widely noted that person has a more limited distribution of agreement and concord possibilities than number and gender. Baker (2008) proposes that this has a universal structural explanation: the subject of adjectival or nominal predication does not merge directly with an adjectival or nominal head, but instead with a higher head Pred. The lack of person agreement on non-verbs emerges when that structural assumption is combined with the Structural Condition on Person Agreement (SCOPA), which bans 1st/2nd person agreement on a head if the bearer of those features does not merge with that head. This paper presents data from original fieldwork on Koryak (Chukotko-Kamchatkan) that challenges SCOPA, as predicative nouns and adjectives (among others) in this language do show covarying person morphology. This paper argues, however, that in Koryak, Pred itself bears uninterpretable phi-features. Once it has agreed with the subject of predication, these features spread to Pred's complement by a highly typologically unusual process of person concord, thus defusing a possible counterexample to Baker's theory.",0
"In Choctaw, a Muskogean language spoken today in Mississippi and Oklahoma, many verb roots participate in a transitivity alternation. However, different intransitive (henceforth 'non-active') verbs have different interpretations. In particular, some have inchoative interpretations and others have passive-like interpretations. Following much work on the semantics of passives and inchoatives across languages, I assume that these two interpretations are distinguished by, at least, the presence vs. absence of an implicit agent. I provide two diagnostics for the presence of an implicit agent in Choctaw, and a further two diagnostics for the absence of one. I then show that some non-active verbs pass both sets of diagnostics - that is, they may introduce or lack an implicit agent depending on context. With this small typology in place, I provide an analysis that employs root-conditioned contextual allosemy of a specifierless Voice head. The analysis captures not only the semantic properties of non-actives, but also their morphology uniformity and their non-productivity.",0
"Some mental states go in pairs with certain physical states. Grammatically, certain Object-Experiencer psych constructions are formed on a regular pattern across languages, that of a psychological predicate or phrase having a physical predicate as a ""root"" and not a psych one. Those constructions can be words, like some Ving and Vant adjectives in English and French, and they can be phrasal, like the desiderative construction in Finnish or the FEEL LIKE construction in Albanian among others. Here, we study the adjectives, such as marrant 'funny,' jaw-dropping and even the effing-class. They have a [ [ Vphy ] ing ]psychA (phy-inside-psych) form, which literally means 'which causes the physical effect usually triggered by the emotion/sensation that it causes,' and actually mean 'which causes that emotion/sensation,' an Object-Experiencer psych meaning.",0
"Quantifying the rate of change of different linguistic features is challenging because the historical evolution of languages is sparsely documented. Consequently, traditional methods rely on phylogenetic reconstruction. Here, we propose a model-based approach to the problem through the analysis of language change as a stochastic process combining vertical descent, spatial interactions, and mutations in both dimensions. A notion of linguistic temperature emerges naturally from this analysis as a dimensionless measure of the propensity of a linguistic feature to undergo change. We demonstrate how temperatures of linguistic features can be inferred from their present-day geospatial distributions, without recourse to information about their phylogenies. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics of language, operating across thousands of years, leave a measurable geospatial signature. This signature licenses inferences about the historical evolution of languages even in the absence of longitudinal data.",1
"By studying the grammaticalization of Romanian auxiliaries from a diachronic Romanian and a comparative Romance perspective, this paper argues that the output of grammaticalization is a predictable pattern in a given language, i.e. a language-specific parametric choice. Specifically, in the passage from old to modern Romanian we observe that a number of emergent periphrastic structures (innovations in contrast to Latin) died out, against the well-known transition from syntheticity to analyticity in the development of the Romance languages (i.e. the profusion of auxiliary structures in this particular situation). In order to account for what appears to be a diachronic paradox, we show that, under a rich cartographic structure of the IP, Romanian auxiliaries systematically grammaticalize as exponents of the category mood; the auxiliaries of the now-defunct periphrases have a richer feature matrix (and this accounts for their demise). The MoodP is also the target of synthetic (finite) verb movement, hence Romanian is, (micro)parametrically, a mood-oriented language, a hypothesis which accounts for the particular diachrony of periphrastic constructions in this language, as well as other properties.",0
"This chapter discusses word classes as applied to signed languages of the world. The chapter provides an overview of various definitions and analyses that have been used to establish word classes in different sign languages. Such definitions are based not only on morphological and syntactic criteria, but also on how the gestural–visual modality affects word classes in terms of iconicity and word formation within and across sign languages. Some of the modality effects on word formation and categorization have in turn also been applied and compared to the gestures of non-signers. Following previous and current work on lexicography and corpus linguistics for sign languages, the chapter also describes some methodological issues and advances in documenting, defining, tagging, and utilizing word classes within these areas of research.",0

"Some Mayan languages display optional verbal agreement with 3pl arguments (Dayley 1985; Henderson 2009; England 2011). Focusing on novel data from Santiago Tz'utujil (ST), we demonstrate that this optionality is not reducible to phonological or morphological factors. Rather, the source of optionality is in the syntax. Specifically, the distinction between arguments generated in the specifier position and arguments generated in the complement position governs the pattern. Only base-complements control agreement optionally; base-specifiers control agreement obligatorily. We provide an analysis in which optional agreement results from the availability of two syntactic representations (DP vs. reduced nominal argument). Thus, while the syntactic operation Agree is deterministic, surface optionality arises when the operation targets two different sized goals.",0
"Although under existential threat in the secular world, Yiddish continues to be a native and daily language for Haredi (Hasidic and other strictly Orthodox) communities, with Hasidic speakers comprising the vast majority of these. Historical and demographic shifts, specifically in the post-War period, in the population of speakers have led to rapid changes in the language itself. These developments are so far-reaching and pervasive that we consider the variety spoken by today's Haredi speakers to be distinct, referring to it as Contemporary Hasidic Yiddish. This chapter presents a study involving 29 native Contemporary Hasidic Yiddish speakers, and demonstrates that significant changes have occurred in the personal pronoun, possessive, and demonstrative systems. Specifically, the personal pronoun system has undergone significant levelling in terms of case and gender marking, but a distinct paradigm of weak pronominal forms exists, independent possessives have lost case and grammatical gender distinctions completely, and a new demonstrative pronoun has emerged which exhibits a novel case distinction.",0

"Rolle (2020) identifies an apparent morphophonological conspiracy in serial verb constructions (SVCs) in Degema. He argues that it constitutes evidence for a partly-unified postsyntactic module, in which morphology and prosody are built in parallel (by 'Optimality-Theoretic Distributed Morphology'). We argue that the pattern Rolle identifies in Degema SVCs instead results from the simultaneous interaction of two independently-attested syntax-prosody phenomena: (1) the pressure for adjacent verbs in an SVC to form a single prosodic unit, and (2) the suppression of redundant agreement within a single prosodic word (a.k.a. 'Kinyalolo's Generalization'). Thus the Degema SVC conspiracy can be localized to the syntax-prosody interface, and there is no need to adopt a unified postsyntactic morphology-prosody module like Rolle's. We offer some further conceptual critiques of his model.",0
Bjorkman & Zeijlstra (2019) claim that agreement with the absolutive argument in ergative-absolutive languages follows naturally in an Upwards-Agree system supplemented by the relation of Accessibility if φ-agreement is parasitic on structural case assigned to the absolutive noun phrase either by T° or by v°. By drawing evidence from two distantly related East Caucasian languages-Chirag and Avar-the present article argues that this theory is both too strong and too weak. I then show that the problematical facts are trivially analysable with standard Agree (Chomsky 2000 et seq.).,0
"This paper presents a dialectometric analysis of Scottish Gaelic morphology, with a focus on the noun phrase, using previously unpublished data from the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. Fifty-five morphological features were extracted across 201 survey points, and the data subjected to a variety of analyses, including cluster analysis, regression, and correlation analysis. We establish that the Gaelic noun system shows robust diatopic (i. e. geographical) variation; this challenges previous assertions in the literature, which describe Gaelic morphosyntax as geographically uniform. In addition, we argue that our dialectometric results provide an insight into the grammatical structure of the language that is not easily achievable through the analysis of individual varieties. In particular, we argue that the results highlight a dissociation between morphological categories such as case and gender and their morphophonological exponents, which are particularly complex in Scottish Gaelic. The paper thus serves as a proof of concept for the use of dialectometric findings in a theoretical context.",1

"This paper shows why it is not a contradiction to say that each language is structurally unique and must be described with its own categories, but language description profits enormously from typological knowledge. It has sometimes been suggested that the Boasian imperative (""each language should be described in its own terms"") leads to uninsightful analyses, and that language description should instead be ""typologically informed"". But the Boasian imperative is not at all incompatible with an intimate connection between description and comparison: Comparative (or typological) knowledge is highly valuable both for making our descriptions transparent and comprehensible, and for helping describers to ask a wide range of questions that would not have occurred to them otherwise. Since we do not know whether any of the building blocks of languages are innate and universal for this reason, we cannot rely on general frameworks (of the generative type) for our descriptions, but we can use typological questionnaires and other kinds of comparative information as a scaffold. Such scaffolds are not theoretical components of the description, but are important methodological tools.",1
"Cyclicity is a common tool in phonology and morphology, but it is a difficult concept to formalize in computational systems. We develop a logical formalization for cyclic phonology and morphology, based on a case study in Armenian. Our formalization is based on a transformational and multistratal adaptation of One-Level Declarative Phonology. We call this system Two-level Declarative Phonology. Our logical formalism is flexible enough to operate over enriched hierarchical (tree-based) representations. The jump in representational power however is restricted by the generative capacity of the system. Most morphological and phonological processes are computationally local, i.e., quantifier-free in our logical system.",0
"Languages use indexical expressions to refer to properties that are dependent on the context of speech. Person indexicals (e.g., 'I'), for example, refer to the participants in the conversation, whereas spatial indexicals (e.g., 'here') specify spaces in relation to the location of the utterance. In this paper, we focus on deixis of person and space, and adopt a learning approach to investigate whether these two indexical categories have a common semantic basis. We present three artificial language experiments that test whether learners assume that new partitions of person and spatial indexicals share the same set of features. Our results suggest that learners tend to generalize a non-native person contrast from a pronominal system to a locative system, but do not extrapolate to the same extent in the opposite direction. Moreover, learners are sensitive to the naturalness of these systems, generalizing only when patterns of homophony between the forms in one system are feature-based, not random.",1
"The process of palaeography is far more complex and time-consuming than the process of

"In all cases of suppletion one needs to ask why the unavailable expected form is not well-formed, and one needs to look for an answer that is independent of the existence of the unexpected form.

"This article provides an introduction to case and agreement patterns that are present in Old, Middle and New Indo-Aryan languages, building on the rationale of Butt and Deo (2017) that ergative case marking and ergative (object) agreement in Indo-Aryan is historically tied to having originated from the past perfective morphological marker ta, and can only be fully understood from a perspective that factors in this development. Particular attention is given to the waxing and waning of ergative properties in Late Middle Indo Aryan and New Indo Aryan, which gives rise to recurring dissociation of case and agreement; specifically, object agreement in the absence of ergative case marking is attested in Kutchi Gujarati and Marwari, while ergative case marking without object agreement is present in Nepali. With regards to case, this article reviews recent insights on how 'ergative/accusative' may be regularly semantically/pragmatically conditioned in Indo-Aryan (so-called Differential Case Marking). Pertaining to agreement, the article investigates a central theoretical question: whether 'ergative' object agreement should be analysed uniformly with subject agreement, or alternatively, as a type of participle agreement – drawing on synchronic parallels between Indo-Aryan and Romance.",0

"Based on V-fronting in Breton, we present a new argument for unifying Long Head Movement (LHM) with phrasal movement as the same operation (Move or Internal Merge). The argument comes from the spellout of movement chains: V-fronting in Breton (an instance of LHM) exhibits the same three spellout options as VP-fronting crosslinguiatically: i) deletion of the clause-internal copy, ii) clause-internal do-support and iii) verb doubling. Although this parallel supports the uniﬁcation of LHM and phrasal movement, we argue that it does not support conflating head and phrasal movement more generally. Instead, the spellout evidence tells us that, while LHM and phrasal movement are the same operation, traditional local head movement is a different operation. This in turn means that local head movement and LHM must be distinct operations, as proposed in Hein 2018, Harizanov & Gribanova 2019, and Arregi & Pietraszko, to appear.",0
"This paper proposes a new diagnostic for the detection of stative sub-events in the decomposition of verbal predicates. The diagnostic is based on a certain type of presupposition triggered by additive operators like Greek ke 'also', which we call Stative Presuppositions. It is argued that the generation of such Stative Presuppositions requires the existence of a syntactically accessible constituent that denotes a predicate of states that additive operators can take scope over. We investigate the distribution of Stative Presuppositions and observe that not all verbs that support inferences to a result state give rise to them. Based on this distribution we argue for a non-uniform analysis of result verbs; whereas some verbs require an event-decompositional analysis, others are better captured by scalar- and incrementality-based analyses. We cast our analysis in the framework of Distributed Morphology and propose to explain non-uniformity based on how different types of verbal roots interact with verbal functional material. Moreover, treating roots as the locus of encyclopedic information explains lexical variation in the generation of Stative Presuppositions within sub-classes of result verbs. We strengthen our conclusions by considering and rejecting alternative syntactic and semantic mechanisms for generating Stative Presuppositions. We conclude that the generation of Stative Presuppositions by additive operators is currently the most reliable diagnostic for the detection of syntactically accessible result states in verbal decomposition.",0
"One of the best-known examples of analogical change---perhaps the best-known---is the leveling of rhotacism, s-r alternations in Latin. Two major theories of this change can be discerned: grammars abhor interparadigmatic stem allomorphy (Mańczak 1957:396f.; Kenstowicz 1996; Campbell 2004:§4.5; Albright 2002: ch. 4, 2005) or that phonological processes tend towards overapplication (Kiparsky 1971, 1982; Roberts 2012, Bermúdez-Otero 2018). In this talk I will argue for a third theory of this analogy, namely that neogrammarian sound change introduces exceptions, exceptions cause loss of productivity, and loss of productivity causes (covert) reanalysis.",0
"In Romance languages, two fundamental types of plural inflection are attested: (i) -i (and -e, -a) in Italian and Romanian varieties; (ii) -s in West Romania, including, in addition to French, Occitan and Ibero-Romance, also Sardinian, Friulian and Rhaeto-Romance varieties, spoken in peripheral areas with respect to Italian-type varieties. In these latter languages, the inflection -i is not totally eradicated but competes with -s. In some North-Lombard dialects of Grisons, spoken in Mesolcina and Bregaglia Valleys (see (1)), feminine plural is lexicalized by the morpheme -ŋ. In neighbouring dialects,feminine and masculine nouns are devoid of plural inflection. Moreover, these varieties are in contact
with Rhaeto-Romance languages with -s in the plural.
The coexistence of these different inflections gives rise to a micro-variation involving a pervasive asymmetric distribution of plural inflection:
 between -s/-ŋ and vocalic plurals
 between determiners (/modifiers) and nouns
 between masculine and feminine plural
In the following sections, we will present the relevant data from the varieties we invetigate. Next, the theoretical framework will be discussed and the observative generalizations will be related to the Phases model proposed in Chomsky (2001)",0
"Many languages of the Mayan family restrict the extraction of transitive (ergative) subjects for focus, wh-questions, and relativization (A'-extraction). We follow Aissen (2017b) in labelling this restriction the ergative extraction constraint (EEC). In this paper, we offer a unified account of the EEC within Mayan languages, as well as an analysis of the special construction known as Agent Focus (AF) used to circumvent it. Specifically, we propose that the EEC has a similar source across the subset of Mayan languages which exhibit it: intervention. The intervention problem is created when an object DP structurally intervenes between the A'-probe on C and the ergative subject. Evidence that intervention by the object is the source of the problem comes from a handful of exceptional contexts which permit transitive subjects to extract in languages which normally ban this extraction, and conversely, a context which exceptionally bans ergative extraction in a language which otherwise allows it. We argue that the problem with A'-extracting the ergative subject across the intervening object connects to the requirements of the A'-probe on C: the probe on C is bundled to search simultaneously for [A'] and [D] features. This relates the Mayan patterns to recent proposals for extraction patterns in Austronesian languages (e.g. Legate 2014; Aldridge 2017b) and elsewhere (van Urk 2015). Specifically, adapting the proposal of Coon and Keine (to appear), we argue that in configurations in which a DP object intervenes between the probe on C and an A'-subject, conflicting requirements on movement lead to a derivational crash. While we propose that the EEC has a uniform source across the family, we argue that AF constructions vary Mayan-internally in how they circumvent the EEC, accounting for the variation in behavior of AF across the family. This paper both contributes to our understanding of parametric variation internal to the Mayan family, as well as to the discussion of variation in A'-extraction asymmetries and syntactic ergativity cross-linguistically.",0
"This paper presents a computational analysis of locality in nonlinear phonology and morphology. Most segmental phonology and concatenative morphology are  computationally local and characterized  by the class of  Input Strictly Local functions. We generalize these functions to consider multiple inputs, i.e.  Multi-Input Strictly Local. We implement this approach using multi-tape automata, and find that they elegantly characterize the bulk of nonlinear suprasegmental phonology and morphology. We demonstrate these results for both tonal phonology and template-filling patterns in root-and-pattern morphology. We show that locality is affected by some theoretical choices (directionality, tier-conflation), but not others (phonological content of templates). For prosodic morphology, nuanced representational choices can affect locality. The flexibility and precision given by the mathematical theory of formal languages provides precise discussion of the nuances of phonological and morphological complexity and substance in a theory-independent but rigorous way.",0
"We derive well-understood and well-studied Subregular classes of formal languages purely from the computational perspective of algorithmic learning problems. We parameterise the learning problem along dimensions of representation and inference strategy. Of special interest are those classes of languages whose learning algorithms are necessarily not prohibitively expensive in space and time, since learners are often exposed to adverse conditions and sparse data. Learned natural language patterns are expected to be most like the patterns in these classes, an expectation supported by previous typological and linguistic research in phonology. A second result is that the learning algorithms presented here are completely agnostic to choice of linguistic representation. In the case of the Subregular classes, the results fall out from traditional model-theoretic treatments of words and strings. The same learning algorithms, however, can be applied to model-theoretic treatments of other linguistic representations such as syntactic trees or autosegmental graphs, which opens a useful direction for future research.",0
"This paper demonstrates that the language of the post-War generations of adult Haredi (i.e. strictly Orthodox), primarily Hasidic, speakers (18 to 87) of Yiddish in the major Hasidic centres worldwide lacks morphological case and gender. Elicited spoken and written data from native Haredi speakers of Yiddish from Israel and the United States, and limited additional evidence from Canada and Belgium reveals a complete absence of distinction between masculine, feminine, and neuter genders as well as between the nominative, accusative, and dative cases. While some speakers make use of a variety morphological definite determiner and attributive adjective forms, their use is not determined by case or gender distinctions. These speakers have an invariable determiner pronounced as /dɛ/ or /di/, and the earlier case and gender suffixes on attributive adjectives have been reanalysed as a single attributive marker, /ɛ/. These findings are consistent with our previous work on the loss of case and gender in the Hasidic Yiddish of London's Stamford Hill, and support our proposal that the Yiddish spoken in (primarily Hasidic) Haredi communities can be considered a distinct variety of the language known as Contemporary Hasidic Yiddish.",0
"Several researchers have suggested that languages vary as to whether number marking on noun phrases is obligatory or optional (Arka & Dalrymple 2017; Biswas 2013; Bylinina & Podobryaev 2020; Corbett 2000; Kim 2005). We develop an implementation of this idea within a theory that assumes that the plural is a semantically vacuous, unmarked number (Sauerland, Anderssen & Yatsushiro 2005 and others). We then explore the semantic consequences of this proposal. One striking prediction of the proposal is that plural nouns should be ungrammatical in antitone environments in languages where number marking is optional, i.e. plurals should be positive polarity items in optional number languages. This prediction arises because the plural form is equivalent to the number neutral bare form in optional number languages. The Efficiency requirement of Meyer (2013) therefore predicts that plurals require local exhaustification in optional number languages since otherwise the bare form is more efficient. Because bare forms are impossible in obligatory number languages, plurals are not predicted to be positive polarity items in such languages. We conclude with an outlook on how to empirically verify the predictions of the theory we presented.",0
"Syncretism has been reported to have the peculiar property of repairing violations of syntactic constraints, e.g. with agreement (Schütze 2003, Bhatt & Walkow 2013) and case matching (Citko 2005, van Craenenbroeck 2012). This paper puts forward the view that in one well-reported instance of syncretism repair of case-matching violations with ATB-movement, this repair follows directly from the nature of ATB movement. We pursue a novel movement-based analysis that has proven to be a marginal approach in the ATB literature; ATB movement involves the actual
fusion of two syntactic objects, via intersection of feature sets, resulting in a single new object. 
As well as deriving the one-to-many relation between fillers and gaps in ATB, we show how the `repair' effect of syncretism with case matching
violations follows naturally once this mechanism of ATB is assumed.",1
"In this thesis, I analyze the distribution of negative markers in sentential negation in Moroccan Arabic. Moroccan Arabic uses two negative markers to denote sentential negation: one in a preverbal position `-ma', and another one following the verb `-sh'.

I propose a structure based on the assumption that Moroccan Arabic has two NegPs. The lower NegP hosts ma in its Spec and the higher NegP is the position where `sh' moves. Moreover, I propose that `ma' is a clitic that left adjoins to the verb once the verb is in a c-commanding position (following Boˇskovi´c's 2002 view on clitics).

This analysis is successful at accounting for the distribution of negative markers in verbal and verbless sentences, and also at solving the problems exhibited by the previous analyses of bipartite negation (Pollock 1989, Rowlett 1998, Benmamoun 1997, Bell 2004).

Furthermore, the same structure also accounts for the syntax of negative sentences containing N-words, under the assumption that sh and N-words cannot co-occur because they compete for the same position, namely the spec of the higher NegP.

Finally, to account for the syntax of negative sentences that carry metalinguistic negation, I propose that the negators are in the CP field, rather than within the TP (following Martins's 2014 view on metalinguistic negation in European Portuguese). This analysis is successful at accounting
for the distribution of metalinguistic negators in both verbal and verbless sentences.",0
"Bobaljik & Zocca (2011) argue that ellipsis reveals the existence of (at least) two classes of gender-paired nouns, distinguished by the relationship between morphological marking and semantic specification: in the actor/actress class, the grammatically feminine form is specified for conceptual gender, while the unaffixed form is unspecified for conceptual gender, exemplifying the classic markedness asymmetry (Jakobson 1932); in the prince/princess class, despite the same morphological relation between the words, both the affixed and unaffixed form are semantically specified for conceptual gender (female and male, respectively). Bobaljik & Zocca and others (see Merchant 2014, Sudo & Spathas 2016, and Saab 2019) pursue accounts that code the difference between the classes in the linguistic representation of such nouns, incorporating (un)markedness into the explanation. By contrast, Haspelmath 2006 has suggested that differences in the relative frequency of the two forms in each pair may be the cause for the different behavior of the two classes. The frequency approach predicts that the size of the acceptability asymmetries that arise under the ellipsis test will correlate with the size of relative frequency ratio for each noun pair. In this article, we develop a formal experimental version of the Bobaljik & Zocca (2011) ellipsis test for gender asymmetries, and deploy it in two experiments: the first is a curated set of 16 noun pairs in English (by hypothesis 8 of each class), and the second is a test of 58 noun pairs forming a nearly exhaustive set of such pairs in English. We then use the freely available COCA corpus (Davies 2008) to test the prediction of the frequency approach. Our results suggest that the Haspelmath 2006 relative frequency hypothesis is not an empirically adequate competitor for the explanation of these asymmetries, as there is no evidence of a correlation between the size of the asymmetry effects in the acceptability judgment experiment and the size of the ratio of the relative frequency of the two forms in each pair for either the curated set of 16 noun pairs or the nearly exhaustive set of 58.",0

"We report ongoing research on linking elements in German compounds, with a focus on noun-noun compounds in which the first constituent is ending in schwa. We present a corpus of about 3000 nouns ending in schwa, annotated for various phonological and morpho-syntactic features, and critically, the dominant linking strategy. The corpus analysis is complemented by an unsuccessful attempt to train neural networks and by a pilot experiment asking native speakers to indicate their preferred linking strategy. In addition to existing nouns, the experimental stimuli included nonce words, also ending in schwa. While neither the corpus study nor the experiment offer a clear picture, the results nevertheless provide interesting insights into the intricacies of German compounding. Overall, we find a predominance of the paradigmatic linking element -n for feminine and masculine nouns. At the same time, the results for nonce words show that -n is not a default strategy.",0
"French suffixations in -age, -ion and -ment are considered roughly equivalent, yet some differences have been pointed out regarding the semantics of the resulting nominalizations. In this study, we confirm the existence of a semantic distinction between them on the basis of a large scale distributional analysis. We show that the distinction is partially determined by the degree of technicality of the denoted action: -age nominals tend to be more technical than -ion ones. We examine this hypothesis through the statistical modeling of technicality. To this end, we propose a linguistic definition of technicality, which we implement using empirical, quantitative criteria estimated in corpora and lexical resources. We show to what extent the differences with respect to these criteria adequately approximate technicality. Our study indicates that this definition of technicality, while amendable, provides new perspectives for the characterization of action nouns.",0
"Aims and Objectives/Purpose/Research Questions: The purpose of the study is to figure out what factors condition the phenomenon of preposition drop in locative, directional and temporal phrases. Specifically, we investigate what kind of phrases allow preposition drop in Russian spoken in Highland Daghestan and aim at understanding the rationale for this phenomenon. 

Design/Methodology/Approach: We conduct a quantitative analysis of data extracted from the Corpus of Russian spoken in Daghestan, which includes interviews with 53 native speakers of 15 Daghestanian and Turkic languages, amounting to 228 thousand tokens.

Data and Analysis: Data from forty-seven (29 male; 18 female) L2 Russian speakers who produced a sufficient number of prepositional phrases (PPs) were included in the analysis. 50 PPs were collected from each speaker resulting in a dataset of 2350 PPs. Each PP was annotated for preposition drop and several sociolinguistic and linguistic parameters. We fitted a logistic mixed-effects regression model to determine which parameters are significant predictors for preposition drop.

Findings/Conclusions. We show that the probability of preposition drop depends on preposition type, phonetic context and the speaker's fluency in Russian. We propose that the prominence of preposition drop in the speech of Daghestanian highlanders results from an interplay of two factors: a typological tendency for certain spatial and temporal locations to be formally unmarked and incomplete acquisition of the Russian prepositional system. 

Originality: This is the first detailed quantitative study of preposition drop, based on an inferential statistical analysis of data from a large number of L2 Russian speakers from Daghestan. 

Significance/Implications: The results show that the apparently contact-induced phenomena like preposition drop may be explained both by typological tendencies and incomplete acquisition of L2. This paper is thus important both for the typological study of this phenomenon and for L2 acquisition research.",0
"For Bjorkman and Zeijlstra (2019), Agree consists of two operations: checking and valuation. Checking involves probing, always upwards from an uninterpretable feature [uF] to an interpretable feature [iF] c-commanding it, and [iF]'s checking [uF]. Valuation generally happens downwards, with the valuer c-commanding the valuee. Upward valuation, in which the probe c-commands the goal, is exceptional and only occurs if downward valuation has failed. In this reply, we argue that this approach is not supported empirically. We present data from Matengo, German, Serbo-Croatian, Sambaa, Liko, and Nez Perce, arguing that upward valuation must be available more generally than Bjorkman and Zeijlstra suggest.",0
"Using novel data from Kipsigis (Southern Nilotic; Kenya), we present the first attested case of across-the-board paradigmatic tonal polarity. The nominative case forms of nominal modifiers (adjectives, possessives, and demonstratives) are segmentally identical to their oblique case counterparts but have the opposite tonal pattern across-the-board: nominative and oblique modifiers differ in not just one but EVERY tonal specification. Kipsigis polarity thus results in maximal tonal contrast between two morphologically related words. We show how the Kipsigis pattern may be captured in an item-and-process theory of morphology with dedicated exchange mechanisms and an item-and-arrangement theory that allows for morpheme-specific phonology; we suggest that an item-and-process approach may provide a more straightforward account.",1
"In addition to comprising a central component of Yiddish lexis, loshn koydesh (Hebrew and Aramaic) structures have historically influenced the development of Yiddish grammar. In this paper we examine the use of loshn koydesh elements among 26 native speakers of contemporary Hasidic Yiddish consisting of two subgroups a) 10 Israeli Hasidic Yiddish speakers, for whom Modern Hebrew is a majority co-territorial language, and b) 12 New York Hasidic Yiddish speakers alongside a small group of 4 London Hasidic Yiddish speakers, for whom English is a majority co-territorial language. Participants were given a written questionnaire with tasks examining three issues: 1) the gender of Hebrew/Aramaic nouns; 2) periphrastic verbs with a Hebrew/Aramaic element; and 3) adjectives derived from the loshn koydesh element of periphrastics. The paper has two aims, namely a) to ascertain whether contact with Modern Hebrew and English has resulted in differences in these speakers' use of the loshn koydesh element of Yiddish, and b) whether there are differences between male and female speakers. Our findings show that there are marked differences on both the geographical and gender axes, many of which are consistent with the speakers' varied exposure to Modern Hebrew, English, and loshn koydesh. We also found that the loshn koydesh component has developed since the pre-War stage of the language and that some of these grammatical changes seem to effect contemporary Hasidic Yiddish usage in all locations and for both genders. We take these developments to provide evidence for the existence of this newly emergent variety of Yiddish – Contemporary Hasidic Yiddish.",0
"The sizeable Indo-European language families are syntactically homogenous, except for the Germanic family. Germanic is the only Indo-European language family that has split into an OV group (continental West Germanic) and a VO-group (English, North-Germanic). The predecessor languages of the modern Indo-European languages are neither OV nor VO, but representative of a third type (T3), as will be argued.  A single Germanic language, namely Yiddish, has preserved (or regained) its type III quality (amidst T3 Slavic languages). 
What is it that has triggered or facilitated the Germanic split? The answer involves a second 'exceptional' trait of Germanic. Germanic is the only Indo-European language family that has developed and maintained the V2 property, with a single language 'left behind', namely English. The grammaticalization of the V2 property has facilitated the change and triggered the transition from T3 to OV and VO, respectively. It is a change from an underspecified to a specified directionality of complement selection by the head of the phrase. OV and VO are the immediate results and the equally likely outcome of fixing the unspecified directionality for identification between verbal head and its dependents in changing a T3 proto-grammar.",0
"A subset of Mayan languages feature ""prosodic allomorphy"", a phenomenon involving morphological alternations at certain prosodic boundaries. In previous work, Henderson (2012) proposes that prosodic allomorphs in K'iche' provide evidence for non-isomorphisms in the correspondence between syntax and prosody. In this paper, I argue against this view by building on a related extraposition analysis in Aissen 1992. I contribute novel data from prosodic allomorphy from two Mayan languages, Chuj and K'iche', and show that upon further inspection, there is strong evidence for a syntactic analysis different from the one assumed in Henderson 2012. The new syntax leads to several predictions that are borne out, and crucially, does not force us to mismatches, allowing us to maintain a one-to-one correspondence between syntax and prosody. By taking apparent instances of mismatches as evidence that the syntactic analysis must be revisited, the proposal thus aligns with work such as Steedman 1991, Wagner 2005, 2010, and Hirsch and Wagner 2015. In the last section of the paper, I discuss how the proposal could be restated within phase theoretic approaches to the interface between syntax and phonology, concluding that Mayan prosodic allomorphy poses an interesting challenge for such accounts.",0
"Turkish expresses two distinct plain polar question meanings based on two attachment options of the polar question clitic. The two forms are both neutral interrogatives felicitous in broad focus, and distinct from other question forms. One placement option comes with a cluster of properties including concealed negation and illocutionary force, and the other with positive evidential bias and default main stress. I show that this duality of primary polar question meanings is due to the presence of either polar {φ, ¬φ}  or projective focal {φ, ψ, π ...} alternatives in the denotation of each of the options. The two meanings arise due to different syntactic outputs, which map to different clitic placement post-syntactically. A singleton-set analysis of polar question meaning such as those by Biezma and Rawlins 2012 and Krifka 2015 can account for the focal reading when amended by focus projection Selkirk 1995. Not predicted by these accounts, broad focus polar alternatives also need to be part of the grammar. The duality makes predictions connecting the kind of the underlying alternatives to negation, bias, and further nuances evident in usage restrictions.",0
"In this paper, I offer an initial description and theoretical analysis of PCC effects and their repair in the Berber language Kabyle. While the PCC has been documented in a wide variety geographically and genetically diverse languages (see Anagnostopoulou 2017, Stegovec 2019 for good overviews), this is the ﬁrst theoretical treatment of the PCC in any Berber variety (though see Belkadi 2010 for mention of the PCC in Kabyle). Kabyle exhibits what has been called the Ultra-Strong PCC, found at least also in Classical Arabic and some varieties of Catalan (Anagnostopoulou, 2017; Fassi Fehri, 1988; Nevins, 2007). Theoretically, I show that the Kabyle facts are consistent with the approach to PCC effects developed by Coon and Keine (pear) in terms of feature gluttony. I further show that their account straightforwardly explains the Kabyle data, including the repair strategy that Kabyle employs.",0
"This dissertation examines the voice system of Amharic. I have studied the voice features including the anticausative and a pair of causative functional items focusing on their selection, interpretation and syntactic projection. The voice items display some interesting properties that made them worth an in­depth investigation. First, the single anticausative morpheme is associated with multiple constructions such as the passive, reciprocal, reflexive, middle and the like. This raises the foundational theoretical problem on the relation between form and meaning. Furthermore, the causative items display quite striking contrasts with the anticausative in selection. The direct causative item filters verb classes. The indirect causative does a similar filtering, but mostly on the types of external arguments. The anticausative, on the other hand, imposes little selection restriction on the verb and argument types. How the selection patterns are correlated with the interpretation and with the syntactic position of the voice items is the main concern of this study. In this dissertation, I have proposed that all the crucial properties of the voice items, including the observed distinctions in selection, projection and interpretation, can be explained by understanding the voice items two types–those that belong to both the syntactic and semantic domains, and those belong to the syntax only. The natural consequence of this understanding is that the syntax specific features could impose selection only within the syntactic component. They freely combine with all semantic classes of verbs. The interface features, on the other hand, impose selection both on the syntactic derivation as well as the semantic composition. The causative items in Amharic are interface features-they merge with their semantic interpretations, as their syntactic categories. Because of this, they impose selection restrictions on the items they merge with not only in their syntactic properties but also on their semantic attributes. The anticausative, on the other hand, is proposed to be a purely syntactic feature. That means, its distribution is fully determined by its syntactic category. Furthermore, I will argue that multiple decausative constructions associated with the anticausative morpheme such as the passive, reciprocal, reflexive, and middle, etc., are not coded into the morpheme itself. The morpheme comes semantically underspecified. The decausative constructions get associated with the morpheme only later in the derivation/composition due to syntax internal contextual factors. This is to mean that the passive,  reflexive, reciprocal and middle constructions are not part of the grammar proper. They are simply allosemes (interpretations) that get assigned later in the semantic component under certain  contexts.",1
"This dissertation develops a formal and psycholinguistic theory of person-based prominence effects, the finding that certain categories of person such as ""first"" and ""second"" (the ""local"" persons) are privileged by the grammar. The thesis takes on three questions: (i) What are the possible categories related to person? (ii) What are the possible prominence relationships between these categories? And (iii) how is prominence information used to parse and interpret linguistic input in real time?

The empirical through-line is understanding obviation - a ""spotlighting"" system, found most prominently in the Algonquian family of languages, that splits the (animate) third persons into two categories: proximate, the person who is in the spotlight, and obviative, the persons who are introduced into the discourse, but are not in the spotlight. I provide a semantics for the feature [proximate], and detail a lattice-based theory of feature composition to derive the categories related to obviation in Border Lakes Ojibwe and beyond. This leads to insights about the syntactic and semantic relationships between person, animacy-based noun classification, number, and obviation.

The novel contribution to the theory of person-based prominence effects is to decompose person features into sets of primitives. This proposal allows the stipulated entailment relationships between categories and features, as encoded in prominence hierarchies and feature geometries, to be derived from the first principles of set theory. I further motivate the account by showing that it has increased empirical coverage, and apply it to capture patterns of agreement and word order in Border Lakes Ojibwe.

Finally, I present a psycholinguistic study on how obviation is used to process filler-gap dependencies in Border Lakes Ojibwe. I show that obviation, and by extension, prominence information more generally, is used immediately to predictively encode movement chains, prior to bottom-up information from voice marking about the argument structure of the clause. I argue for a modular and syntax-first model of parsing, revising the Active Filler Strategy to be guided by pressures to minimize syntactic distance and maximize the expected well-formedness of each link in the chain. These pressures compete, accounting for effects of prediction, integration, and reanalysis in long-distance dependency formation.

"This paper explores the nature of the post-syntactic operations responsible for the representations of the linear order of terminal nodes. In particular, it argues in favor of a unified model of the morphosyntax and morphophonology, wherein the theory of Distributed Morphology and Optimality Theory operate in a single module. The testing ground is an investigation of the formation of morphological causatives in Moroccan Arabic. Herein, the process of realizing causatives is morphological gemination, whereby the second consonant of the root is doubled. Investigating the question of what triggers the infixal process, I argue against the linearization algorithm suggested in Embick & Noyer (2001), Embick & Marantz (2008), and Embick (2006, 2010). Instead, the claim I defend here is that the onus of the linearization process falls on the prosody in Arabic, the central assumption being that the morphosyntactic structure, the output of the syntactic derivation, is the input to OT morphophonological constraints. These constraints are responsible for the linearization of the terminal nodes of the syntactic derivation. I show that adopting one theory over others misses important generalizations about the language.",0
"The title of this dissertation indicates its goal: to determine the computational aspects of cyclic phonology as it operates in Armenian. This goal is divided into two subgoals based on empirical and computational questions. 

On the empirical side, I show that Armenian requires a model of the morphology-phonology interface which is interactionist and cyclic, i.e., that morphological structure, prosodic structure, and phonological rules cyclically interact to create new words. Evidence for this nuanced organization comes from the stratal phonology of Armenian (cf. Lexical Phonology and Stratal OT: Kiparsky 1982; Bermúdez-Otero 2018). There are phonological processes which apply differently before derivational morphology than in inflectional morphology. The main process that I examine is destressed high vowel reduction. This and other processes indicate not only different strata or levels, but also show signs of unbounded cyclicity and sensitivity to sublexical prosodic constituents, i.e., the Prosodic Stem (Downing 1999). These processes are active in both simplex and compound words. Within compounds, the interaction of all these factors creates bracketing paradoxes. I solve these paradoxes using a mixture of cyclic prosodic phonology and Head-Operations (Hoeksema 1988). I show that counter-cyclic approaches to bracketing paradoxes, like Morphological Merger or Rebracketing (Marantz 1988), are inadequate because they contradict the rest of Armenian phonology. 

There are many different incarnations of cyclic theories of phonology but there are little to no computational analyses of them. I develop an extensive computational formalization for cyclic or interactionist phonology by using Monadic-Second Order (MSO) logic, specifically graph-to-graph logical transductions. Logic is a flexible tool that lets us create iconic formalizations which faithfully replicate phonological theory. I utilize logical transductions as a way to encode the derivational nature of phonology. The formalism is a generalization of the work from one-level Declarative Phonology (Bird 1995; Coleman 1998) to a two-level framework. By formalizing the morphology, prosody, and phonological rule domains, I uncover implicit factors within cyclic phonology. The ultimate takeaway is that I show that the bulk of the morphology-phonology interface requires local computation, not global computation. By being local, the computational nature of the morphology-phonology interface opens doors to understanding how we can provably learn morpho-phonological processes and how these processes relate to limitations on human cognition (cf. Heinz 2018).",0
"Morphological complexity is expected to decrease under mass admixture from adult second language speakers. While this has been chiefly shown for morphological richness, an unresolved question is whether the effect extends to aspects of morphological boundedness. Here we report a case study of Sino-Tibetan verbs, contrasting verbal expressions of two languages with very large (Chinese, Burmese) and of two languages with very small (Bunan, Chintang) numbers of second language speakers. We find that while the amount of second language speakers accounts for differences in the range and number of inflectional categories (degrees of synthesis), it does not affect the way in which morphological constituents are bound together, reflecting fortification through a mix of diachronically stable and universally preferred patterns. This calls for theoretical models that narrow down the range of changes that are driven by second language speaker admixture, and for extensive empirical testing on a global scale.",1
"This dissertation explores the complex interactions between syntax and the form-related modules of grammar: morphology, and phonology. In particular, I consider how syntactic elements are mapped to different units in these modules, focusing primarily on what we intuitively label as words. The empirical domain is verb and auxiliary patterns, as this particular domain has rich variation in whether tense, mood, aspect and valency changing morphology is expressed in single or multi-word constructions. On the surface the choice for an inflectional category being expressed as auxiliary or affix seems arbitrary. In this dissertation, however, I argue that it is not as arbitrary as it may appear. I explore how the expression of features in one or more words can differ systematically cross-linguistically and propose that syntactic word-formation is sensitive to syntactic domains (phases). In order to do so, I approach this problem from various angles. Chapter 2 focuses on an in-depth investigation of two head-final languages (Japanese and Turkish) and mismatches between syntactic and phonological word-hood tests. I show that these mismatches follow from particular word building processes and their interaction with syntactic domains. Hence these mismatches are not arbitrary. Chapter 3 explores the status of word building operations, and the idea that timing differences in the derivation lead to variation in auxiliary patterns. I provide evidence that auxiliary patterns in a language pattern with other phenomena that align with the timing of word building, such as matching constraints in ellipsis. Chapter 4 focuses on correlations between domains in word building and domains in the syntax, i.e., correlations between auxiliaries and phases. Finally, chapter 5 explores which inflectional features are expressed in single or multi-word expression in a cross-linguistic sample of 33 languages from 18 families. I show that inflectional categories inside the first phase do not participate in periphrasis.  I show that there is more uniformity than initial appearances suggest in the expression of features as single words or periphrastic constructions, and that there may be universal aspects to the analysis. Furthermore, the apparent mismatches between phonological and syntactic tests for word-hood are in fact regular consequences of the relevant processes and their timing pointing to the need for a more integrated approach to cross-modular research.",1
"Nilo-Saharan languages are well-known for their complicated system of nominal number marking, which features a variety of singulative and plural affixes (Dimmendaal 2000). Even though these systems have received some attention in the typological literature, there has been limited theoretical work on their implications for the morphosyntax of number cross-linguistically. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap, by providing an analysis of nominal number morphology in Kipsigis (Nilotic, Kenya), based on data from original fieldwork. First, I show that singulatives in Kipsigis are true allomorphs of singular number, unlike singulatives with a classifier function in languages like Ojibwe (Mathieu 2012). The descriptive term 'singulative' is therefore misleading, as it corresponds to two very different types of morphemes. Second, I claim that the tripartite system of number marking of Kipsigis and other Nilo-Saharan languages is due to the classification of nouns into morphosyntactic classes defined by the presence of inherent number features on little n; the interaction of these features with interpretable number features on the functional projection Num (Ritter 1991 a.o.) in the post-syntactic component gives rise to the exponence pattern that we observe. Finally, my analysis corroborates the existence of noun classification based on number, which has only been argued for Kiowa-Tanoan before (Harbour 2007). The existence of three number classes in Kipsigis can only be explained by reference to bivalent number features; number- based noun classification systems thus strongly support the view that number features are bivalent and not privative, which is also argued by Harbour (2007, 2011) for Kiowa.",0
"We argue that Abaza, a polysynthetic language from the Northwest Caucasian family, exhibits a syntax-semantics mapping that has not been observed in any other languages before. We show that Abaza lacks wh-words and, as a consequence, matrix and embedded wh  interrogative clauses, and conveys direct and indirect content question meaning by means of headless relative clauses. We propose a compositional semantic analysis of these headless relative clauses that assigns them the same meaning as concealed question DPs, i.e. individual concepts. When occurring as matrix clauses and conveying direct question meaning, these headless relative clauses require the relative verbal form to contain a clause typing affix from a specific set. We show that these affixes cannot be analyzed as ""incorporated"" or ""cliticized"" wh-words, but rather as operators turning individual concepts into questions,i.e., sets of propositions.",0
"The most basic question for the study of morphology and the mental lexicon is whether or not words are _decomposed_: informally, this is the question of whether words are represented (and processed) in terms of some kind of smaller units; that is, broken down into constituent parts. Formally, what it means to represent or process a word as decomposed or not turns out to be quite complex. One of the basic lines of division in the field classifies approaches according to whether they decompose all ""complex"" words (""Full Decomposition""), or none (""Full Listing""), or some but not all, according to some criterion (typical of ""Dual-Route"" models). However, if we are correct, there are at least three senses in which an approach might be said to be decompositional or not, with the result that ongoing discussions of what appears to be a single large issue might not always be addressing the same distinction. Put slightly differently, there is no single question of decomposition. Instead, there are independent but related questions that define current research. Our goal here is to identify this finer-grained set of questions, as they are the ones that should assume a central place in the study of morphological and lexical representation.",1
"In this paper, we outline some of the main ways that phenomena traditionally referred to as ""derivation"" have been treated in Distributed Morphology (DM), focusing on the general issue of how the characteristics of derivation emerge from the grammar. We begin in the first half of the paper by discussing the status of derivation, focusing on criteria that classically distinguish between derivation and inflection, on the one hand, and derivation and compounding, on the other. We also discuss the relevance of the distinction between ""words"" and ""phrases"" to widespread notions of what counts as derivational morphology. The thrust of this section is to explain why ""derivation"" is not a primitive notion in DM, and to give a first sense of how DM handles phenomena traditionally treated as derivational. In the second half of the paper, we turn to a structural distinction that does fall out from the architecture of grammar adopted in most work within DM-specifically, the distinction between inner and outer affixation. We focus primarily on category-changing morphology and different proposals for what, structurally, counts as ""inner"" vs. ""outer"", and what empirical effects this distinction corresponds to. We also discuss some ways in which ""category change"" is not necessarily a structurally unified notion. Finally, we turn to various (mostly prepositional) prefixing phenomena and discuss how these may reflect the inner/outer distinction as well.",0
"In this paper, I introduce a hitherto undescribed ellipsis variety present in a number of head-final languages including Eastern Armenian, Digor and Iron Ossetic, and Turkish. The material deleted under this type of ellipsis demonstrably does not form a constituent. I show that this phenomenon cannot be analyzed as a series of constituent deletions. I propose that this ellipsis variety involves extra deletion of some material adjacent to a gapping site (specifically, a part of a DP or a PP) rather than mere deletion of a constituent. I proceed to argue that the existence of extra deletion necessarily implies that deletion must take place after linearization.",1

"Athapaskan verbal morphology appears to violate the Mirror Principle of Baker (1985) in multiple ways and, thus, the ordering of affixes in these languages has resisted a straightforward analysis. We adopt a new morphological tool of Iterative Root Prefixation (Travis 2011), which allows for a more direct mapping from syntax to morphology in languages of this profile. Apparent violations of affix ordering that remain, namely the puzzling placement of the transitive and causative morphemes, are argued to be explained by overriding phonological constraints.",0
"The goal of this paper is to describe a new set of modals that is appearing in contemporary English. The 
epistemic modals with perfect have are forming a new class including mighta, coulda, woulda, shoulda, 
and musta, when they are used with an additional have. This use is accepted widely. There is a further 
stage where the new modal is selecting an infinitive as its complement, i.e. without a (present) perfect 
meaning, not widely accepted. I describe this set of changes as a cycle because there is both economy and 
renewal at work. The framework used is Minimalist (Chomsky 1995 and onwards), with a more articulated 
TP-layer. The data come from corpus and internet sources; the study is not a quantitative one because the

"P(reposition)-stranding is typologically rare. Nevertheless, many languages exhibit phenomena that look like P-stranding (Campos 1991; Poplack, Zentz, and Dion 2012) or involve P-stranding under common theorizing (see Philippova 2014 and references therein). These studies argue that these are not instances of P-complement movement and provide alternative analyses. This squib addresses Russian prepositions that can be postposed to and apparently stranded by their dependents. They are proposed to be PPs rather than P-heads, with dative dependents adjoined similarly to external possessors. The analysis captures all idiosyncrasies of their nominal dependents and alleviates the need to posit exceptional P-stranding in Russian.",0
"The term 'borrowing', especially when applied to bound morphology, often describes phenomena that, while appearing to be identical, are, in reality, not coextensive. By combining data and analyses from contact linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science, this study provides an explicit and principled treatment of different phenomena of morphological transfer, showing that a demarcation reflects psycholinguistic facts, which, if analyzed properly, allow us to gain useful insights into synchronic bilingual processing and diachronic language change. In particular, it is claimed that morphological borrowing occurs via cross-language structural priming and that speakers have the ability to relate to the internal structure of words ('morphological relatability'), which can interfere with the inhibitory control mechanism that preempts access to the non-targeted language, and override it, thereby enabling morphological priming. A large body of evidence, ranging from experimental psycholinguistics to language change and first language acquisition, underpins this assumption. Relatable morphology is claimed to be a precondition for morphological transfer and borrowing to occur, and a Stratal Effect is hypothesized, which, applying to varying extent, gives rise to at least three distinct types of morphological transfer. Finally, the mainstream view according to which affix borrowing can be either direct or indirect is dismissed, and it is shown that affix borrowing always involves an indirect process including extrapolation of relatable formatives and their diffusion within the lexicon.",0
"This paper shows that the distribution of (non‑)finiteness in the South Slavic languages reflects an implicational scale along an independently attested semantic complementation hierarchy (e.g., Givón 1980). We suggest that in the South Slavic languages, finiteness is triggered by clausal agreement features associated with different syntactic heads. Building on a complexity approach to the complementation hierarchy, we propose that cross-linguistic variation in finiteness and variation across different types of complements are the result of language-specific differences in the distribution of agreement features. More broadly, we conclude that there is no (universal) semantic correlate of (non‑)finiteness and, contra cartographic approaches, that finiteness is not confined to a particular domain in the clause. Following Adger (2007), we argue that finiteness can be distributed over all clausal domains.",0
"An important ongoing discussion in theories of argument structure concerns the explanatory division of labor between thematic properties and event structure. In this context, the English get-passive provides an interesting test case. Much previous work has analyzed get-passives as differing thematically from be-passives. Yet many get- passive properties remain poorly understood. We present an analysis of the get-passive centered on the proposal that it contains additional event structure (realized as get) relative to its be counterpart. We employ by-adjuncts to identify the event structures in passive types, and demonstrate that the behavior of this and other diagnostics support the conclusion that get- and be-passives differ systematically in ways that accord with our analysis. Further discussion considers the prominent proposal from previous studies that get-passives differ thematically from be-passives in (sometimes) assigning an Agent role to their surface subjects. We show that there is no evidence for such an analysis. Instead, intuitions about the interpretation of the get-passive surface subject arise from how an event's Responsible Party is identified: contrasts between get and be on this dimension are a consequence of event structural differences between the two. The overall result is a unified analysis of the get-passive, one that has implications for the role of event structure in understanding the syntax and interpretation of arguments.",0
"We address the relationship between syntactic valency and voice morphology in Hittite (Anatolian, Indo-European), focusing on cases where active syntax is expressed using non-active morphology, and vice versa. We argue that apparent ""mismatches"" between syntax and morphology are strictly a morphological rather than a syntactic phenomenon (contra Alexiadou et al. 2015; Grestenberger 2018). Our study highlights voice ""reversals""-i.e., cases in which the expected mismatch disappears and morphological and syntactic valency match. We determine that such reversals correlate with morphological locality, and cannot be derived by hierarchical factors. Our findings provide a novel argument for a uniform syntactic structure of voice (Wood 2015; Wood & Marantz 2018).",0
"It is often argued that words have complex internal structure in terms of their morphology, phonology, and semantics. On the surface, Armenian compounds present a bracketing paradox between their morphological and phonological structure. I argue that this bracketing paradox simultaneously references endocentricity, strata, and prosody. I use Armenian as a case study to argue for the use of cyclic approaches to bracketing paradoxes over the more common counter-cyclic approaches. I analyze the bracketing paradox using cyclic Head-Operations (Hoeksema 1984) and Prosodic Phonology (Nespor and Vogel 1986), specifically the Prosodic Stem (Downing 1999a). I argue that the interaction between the bracketing paradox and the rest of compound phonology requires the use of stratal levels and cyclicity. I argue that counter-cyclic approaches like Morphological Merger (Marantz 1988) or Morphological Rebracketing (Sproat 1985) are inadequate because they make incorrect predictions about Armenian phonology.",0
"In this paper, we provide an in-depth study of the morphosyntactic behavior of negative verb clusters in the Finno-Ugric languages Udmurt and Mari. We argue that the standard treatment of negation as an auxiliary is inadequate for these languages as it does not explain its morphosyntactic and morphophonological behavior, which presents a challenging morphology-syntax-semantics mismatch: Despite taking high scope and governing the highest verb of the clause, negation surfaces immediately before the highest verb rather than at the end of the verb cluster as would be expected in head-final languages. Furthermore, we show that negation forms a complex unit with the highest verb of the clause and thus crucially differs from negative auxiliaries in other Finno-Ugric languages like Finnish and from other auxiliaries. We argue that the properties of negation are best modelled by means of postsyntactic Lowering (Embick and Noyer 2001). Next to the semantic vacuousness of the displacement, the main arguments for a postsyntactic perspective come from the internal constituency of the verb cluster, the possibility to interleave clitics inside the verb cluster only in the presence of negation, and cases where Lowering fails and a syntacto-semantically inert copula is inserted as a repair. We show that competing approaches to complex head formation based on narrow-syntactic head-movement, flexible spell-out in different positions or base-generation fail to capture the crucial properties of negative verb clusters. On a more general level, we thus provide evidence for the necessity of post-syntactic mechanisms for word formation and a serial architecture of the morphology-syntax interface.",0
"This chapter has been submitted to an upcoming handbook on Distributed Morphology. The chapter reviews cases of word/word blocking and word/phrase blocking from the literature, clarifying in each case to what extent they fall under the notion of blocking as understood in DM and to what extent they might receive alternative explanations.

"The operation known as Fission in Distributed Morphology has figured prominently in accounting for discontinuous agreement in verbal paradigms-that is, the exponence of agreement with a single argument which is distributed over more than one position on the verb. Fission is often seen as a by-product of a composite Vocabulary Insertion mechanism determining which features are split up, where they are linearized, and how they are spelled out. An alternative view which presupposes a modular postsyntax assigns operational autonomy to rules responsible for feature splitting, displacement, and exponence. I argue that the latter approach is empirically superior on the basis of a novel set of allomorphic alternations from Semitic which demonstrate that Fission and displacement feed, and hence cannot be equated with, Vocabulary Insertion. The result is that the inventory of postsyntactic operations must include at least the following three operations: Fission, Metathesis, and Vocabulary Insertion.",0
"Many scholars, such as Feng (1997/2012), Huang (1999; 2013), Huang et al. (2009), Lin (2009; 2015), Liu (2012; 2016), Liu and Huang (2013; 2016), Tang (2001) and Ting (1993; 1998) have assumed that long and short bei-passives in Mandarin have distinct syntactic structures. For them, one crucial distinction is that while short bei-passives involve A-movement of PRO, long bei-passives involve A'-movement of a null operator (NOP). In this paper, I expand upon Her's (2009) original proposal arguing that both long and short passives involve A'-movement and thus should have a unified account  and I present new evidence showing that in both passives, the complement to bei must at least be as large as Asp, contra Bruening and Tran's (2015) suggestion that it can only be as large as (passive) Voice (Kratzer 1996). My account requires that both constructions have VoicePass, also contra Bruening and Tran (2015), which accounts for a range of novel data: both long and short bei-passives can license a unique class of verbal compounds that are also grammatical in the gei ('give'), jiao ('ask') and rang ('allow') passives, and in passives embedded in ba-constructions, but importantly are ungrammatical in active constructions, which have VoiceAct.",0
"This squib documents a novel empirical generalization from selection in Semitic: lexically selected arguments can vary by (verbal) template. This discovery is problematic for current analyses which take (lexically) selected arguments to either be introduced by the root (Harley 2014) or by the categorizing head (Merchant 2019), both of which are lower than the functional heads realized as Semitic templates. Templates can induce alternations in argument structure (e.g. causativization) and diathesis (e.g. passivization)---characteristics typically associated with v and Voice. A solution is sketched whereby PPs can be jointly selected by the root, categorizing head, and template-defining head.",0
"In cases of indexical-shift, so-called indexical pronouns like 'I', 'you', 'here' and 'now' refer to the Speaker, Addressee, Location, and Time of some other context than the utterance-context. In cases of perspectival anaphora, an anaphor tracks the perspective of some other individual than the utterance Speaker (or Addressee). Thus, both phenomena involve referential obviation of a pronoun or anaphor from the utterance- context. Such obviation also occurs under highly similar grammatical conditions, e.g. in the scope of an attitude predicate (e.g. 'say', 'think', 'perceive'). Here, I introduce the core properties of both phenomena and show that they actually stand in a subset- superset relation. The availability of indexical-shift in a given environment entails that of perspectival anaphora, but not vice-versa. I describe a plausible way to make sense of these insights within a unified model of attitude shift which in turn helps chart out clear avenues for future research.",0
"In many so-called consistent null subject languages, null and overt subject pronouns have contrasting referential preferences: null subjects tend to maintain reference to the preceding subject while overt pronominal subjects do not. We propose that children acquire this contrast by initially restricting their attention to 1st and 2nd person pronouns, whose reference is simpler to infer compared to 3rd person pronouns. Spontaneous production from Mexican Spanish shows that (i) the null/overt contrast is in principle acquirable from 1st and 2nd person subject pronouns in naturalistic input; (ii) children's production of 1st and 2nd person subjects is conditioned by this contrast, and (iii) the contrast is generalized to the 3rd person slightly later in development. A pronoun resolution task shows that children use the null/overt contrast in comprehension at the same age that it becomes apparent in production.",0
"This thesis examines argument structure - the linking relations between verbs and their arguments - in Choctaw, a Muskogean language spoken in Mississippi and Oklahoma. My focus is on three morphological reflexes of argument structure, which constitute the argument-marking systems of the title. Firstly, the verb may host various morphological markers of voice, which often carry labels like 'transitive' or 'causative'. Secondly, the verb may host clitics which index (or 'double') certain arguments. Thirdly, overt arguments may carry case-markers. Following recent work in Minimalism and Distributed Morphology, I argue that each of these morphological systems is 'read off' a syntactic structure, which encodes verbal argument structure through a root and an arrangement of functional heads (v, Voice, Appl). This syntactic structure must make use of, at least, trivalent specifier requirements, in the sense of Kastner (2020), and a licensing relation. And in the mappings from syntactic structure to morphological and semantic output, there must be a high degree of contextual conditioning, in the sense of Wood and Marantz (2017). Of particular relevance to the syntax-morphology interface, I argue that case-assignment is morphological, and subject to contextual conditioning in the same way that morphological exponence is.",1

"Significantly revised. Baker and Vinokurova (2010) and Baker (2015) present a two-modality approach to case assignment, in which different cases may be assigned in one of two ways: either configurationally, as in Marantz (1991), where case is assigned depending on its location and its relationship with other nominals in its domain, or assigned via agreement with functional heads, as in Chomsky (2000). In particular, they argue that the assignment of nominative and genitive case cannot be assigned configurationally based on agreement patterns in Sakha, a Siberian Turkic language. In the spirit of Levin and Preminger (2015), I argue that needing to posit two different modalities of case is not necessary, and that their data can be accounted for with one. However, unlike Levin and Preminger (2015) who provide purely theoretical arguments in favor of their conclusion, I provide four empirical arguments for genitive case being assigned as an unmarked case (and, by extension, nominative) not just in Sakha, but other Turkic languages as well.",0
"This dissertation provides new empirical discoveries with consequences both for how case is assigned and the range of possible types of cases. I explore the relationship between Voice, case, and subjecthood through the lens of Lithuanian, a Baltic language. Specifically demonstrate that Lithuanian exhibits an active existential Voice – a Voice which assigns accusative case to a grammatical object and is realized by active morphology, but whose external argument is not syntactically projected. This finding counterexempliﬁes Burzio's (1986) Generalization and its alternative versions. Empirical work on case has established a distinction between two cases, structural vs. non-structural (Chomsky 1981, 1986; Woolford 2006; Pesetsky and Torrego 2011). My dissertation challenges this dichotomy by identifying a type of case, namely marked structural, that falls between these categories depending on the syntactic environment it is realized in. Lastly, this dissertation provides important insights for subjecthood theories by identifying two types of non-nominative subjects in the language. I demonstrate that non-nominative subjects can vary in terms of their case assignment and do not constitute a homogeneous class.",0

"Kiparsky (1997) distinguishes structurally between two types of verbs incorporating nouns: a) true denominals (noun-derived verbs), which imply the use of the incorporated noun (like ""tape""), and b) pseudo denominals (root-derived verbs), which do not, like ""hammer"". However, Harley & Haugen (2007) argue that the distinction between true and pseudo denominals is not structural, but pragmatic, as one could tape with band-aids, not necessarily just tape. Our paper brings experimental evidence from two acceptability judgment tasks answered by 100 native speakers of English in favor of the pragmatic nature of the distinction between true and pseudo denominal verbs. Participants had to rate sentences where both 'true' and 'pseudo' denominals combined with similar on-similar PPs (""He crowned her ??with a hat/with a rose garland""- true, ""Tom paddled the canoe with a board/??with a spoon""-pseudo).The results show significant effects of the semantic similarity of the PPs to the denominal verb's incorporated object on the acceptability of sentences with denominals. Thus, instead of arguing that only some denominals are root-derived (Kiparsky 1997), we argue that all denominals are derived from nominal roots expressing n-like concepts, and that acceptability in combination with various PPs is merely a function of the similarity between the nominal root and the PP.",1
"In this paper, I demonstrate that Swahili distinguishes two types of resumptives pronouns: i) lower A-bar movement copies and ii) base generated bound pronouns. These  two types of resumptive pronouns are morphologically distinct:  the presence of (local) person features reflects a base-generated derivation and the absence of person features reflects A-bar movement. Crucial data comes from local person pronominal clefts derived from islands (bound pronoun context) and parasitic gaps (movement copy context). Inspired by van Urk (2017), I analyze this pattern using Landau's (2006) theory of chain reduction in which only movement copies create chains and are then subject to an algorithm which deletes person features.",0
"Despite the growing interest in endangered languages, relatively little attention has been paid to the ways in which the structure of these languages is conditioned by the language shift setting, even among conservative older speakers. This thesis investigates how the social circumstances of language endangerment-which include disrupted intergenerational transmission, loss of a cohesive speech community, pressure to master a new dominant language, and stigmatization of the traditional language-can have signiﬁcant grammatical effects. I investigate morphosyntactic variation among different groups of speakers of the highly endangered polysynthetic indigenous language Chukchi, which is spoken in northeastern Russia.

In order to systematically compare linguistic patterns among speakers of different backgrounds (proﬁcient older speakers, attriting speakers, and young L2 or heritage learners), I utilize a combination of traditional ﬁeldwork techniques and controlled experimental production tasks. I focus on several distinct reﬂexes of the encoding of argument structure, which cuts across multiple morphosyntactic domains and thus affords us the opportunity to examine not only individual grammatical changes due to language shift, but also system-wide grammatical restructuring that can only be seen as a direct result
of the modern sociolinguistic setting.

Modern Chukchi speakers evidence variation across the following domains: agreement marking, morphological and syntactic ergativity, valency-changing derivational morphology, verbal and nominal incorporation, and argument drop. While older, highly proﬁcient speakers display patterns that are largely consistent with existing grammatical descriptions, attriting speakers and L2 speakers show deviations from the expected patterns, though not always in identical ways. Attriting and L2 speakers reanalyze agreement marking across different dimensions, and while both groups make little productive use of verbal derivation and incorporation, this tendency is more pronounced among L2 learners. However, these varieties are alike in that the changes present in the grammars of these speakers are entirely consistent with cross-linguistic tendencies and a shift away from a polysynthetic conﬁguration. Furthermore, while similar changes in other moribund languages have often been characterized as ""linguistic loss,"" the Chukchi data show that as certain features are lost, speakers innovate new patterns to replace them, often making use of existing resources in the language (rather than borrowing from or replicating patterns in the contact language).",0
"Any theory of morphology must answer two questions about allomorphy: first, what considerations govern the form of morphemes, and second, under what conditions can one morpheme influence the shape of another. Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993) allows allomorphy to be conditioned in many components of the grammar: syntax, phonology, and the lexicon. In no small part, the specific pronunciation of morphemes depends on rules of Vocabulary Insertion--the subject of this review. We start with a general review of what allomorphy is, and how it has been classified analytically both in DM and in other theories of morphology and phonology. After sketching some analyses of simple cases of allomorphy, we build towards more complex examples, considering various issues they raise. One is whether, from a structural point of view, allomorphy is conditioned differently by inner vs. outer context. Another is how far away the conditioning environment can be from the affected morpheme. We also review various theory-internal debates within DM, including the role of linear adjacency, how competition for insertion is resolved, and whether this competition is a property of roots. We end with a discussion of broader questions about allomorphy as a phonological and a morphosyntactic phenomenon.",0

"I focus on the so-called Oku's generalization in order to show: (i) that a main division among at least two types of pro-drop languages is irreducible, i.e., radical vs. consistent pro-drop (pace Duguine 2013), and (ii) that the distinction can be understood in terms of two types of ellipsis, namely phrasal DP-ellipsis (Japanese) and head pronoun ellipsis (Spanish). Such a distinction follows from a general model for ellipsis within and across languages and does not have to be stipulated for the particular distribution of null subjects in Japanese and Spanish. Thus, the difference between radical and consistent pro-drop languages does not follow from the deep vs. surface anaphora distinction, but from the timing of ellipsis in each language. In addition, I conjecture that the lack of DP-ellipsis in Spanish, and consistent pro-drop languages in general, is due to the agreement-Case system. In this respect, my analysis is committed to the so-called anti-agreement hypothesis, according to which the availability of DP-ellipsis is connected to absence of morphological agreement. Finally, even when I dispense with the deep vs. surface distinction as a way of deriving Oku's generalization, I claim that null NP anaphora, a type of deep anaphora, is syntactically active at least in radical and partial pro-drop languages (Barbosa 2019).

"The person marking system of Äiwoo (Oceanic, Austronesia ; Solomon Islands) shows a split along the lines of both a person hierarchy (2 > 1 > 3) and a number hierarchy (AUG > MIN). I analyze this as a direct/inverse split, where object agreement only ensues in the inverse comfigurations, that is, where the subject is ranked lower than the object on a combination of the two hierarchies. I model it with Deal's (2015) agreement, based on the notions of interaction and satisfaction. I argue that the Äiwoo probe has a disjunctive satisfaction condition: it interacts with any nominal, but it halts as soon as it agrees with a goal carrying a feature [ADDRESSEE] *or* a feature [AUGMENTED].",0
"In Spanish causative constructions with dejar 'let' and hacer 'make' the subject of the embedded infinitive verb can appear in the accusative or the dative case. This case alternation has been accounted for by resorting to the notion of direct vs. indirect causation. Under this account, the accusative clitic with a transitive verb denotes direct causation while the dative clitic with an intransitive verb expresses indirect causation. The problem with this account is that we lack an independent definition of (in)direct causation in this context and so this approach suffers from circularity: the case of the clitic is used to determine causation type and causation type implies use of one or the other grammatical case. Therefore, a more objective way to account for clitic case alternation is needed. In this paper, I offer one possible solution in this direction by investigating clitic case alternation against Hopper and Thompson's Transitivity parameters and a small number of other linguistic variables. The analysis is conducted on a dataset of 4,589 sentences analysed with Bayesian mixed-effects models and a large random forest. The results indicate that the transitivity of the infinitive verb, the animacy of the object and the agentivity of the subject are strong predictors of clitic case but there are also important dialectal differences. The findings in this paper allow us to arrive at a finer-grained characterization of the contexts in which each case is more likely to occur and provide further evidence of the pervasiveness of Transitivity in natural language.",0
"We propose a theory of head displacement that replaces traditional Head Movement and Lowering with a single syntactic operation of Generalized Head Movement. We argue that upward and downward head displacement have the same syntactic properties: cyclicity, Mirror-Principle effects and blocking in the same syntactic configurations. We also study the interaction of head displacement and other syntactic operations arguing that claimed differences between upward and downward displacement are either spurious or follow directly from our account. Finally, we show that our theory correctly predicts the attested crosslinguistic variation in verb and inflection doubling in predicate clefts.",0
"The paper discusses a class of transitive-prepositional reflexive constructions, tied to the sphere of inalienable possession. The characteristic property of this pattern is the sometimes implicit, but often overt and obligatory presence of a locative PP which embeds a body-part noun in a VP which is otherwise monotransitive. Figure reflexive constructions are syntactically unified by the fact that their internal argument is conceptualized as a prepositional small clause, which introduces the Figure-Ground relation. These constructions are also Voiced, in the sense that an external argument position is projected even if it may be non-thematic. Unaccusatives are analyzed as introducing an expletive, i.e. non-thematic Voice projection, whose role is simply to signal that the event structure of transitives and derived unaccusatives is the same, consisting of a causing subevent and a result state. The discussion of unaccusatives is theoretically relevant in that it strengthens the suggestion that there is a connection between the expletivization of Voice and derived reflexive unaccusativity.",0

"The lack of third person adnominal pronouns in English-type languages (*they linguists) is argued to be an effect of contextually conditioned allomorphy between the exponents of the definite article and third person pronouns within a pronominal determiner structure. A crosslinguistic survey of 82 languages finds that the third person gap is crosslinguistically relatively rare and may be restricted to Europe and surrounding areas. The survey also suggests a potential
interaction between the third person gap and the availability of distinct articles, as expected on the ­proposed analysis. The paper also discusses issues raised by the third person gap for alternative analyses, including those advocating an NP-analysis.",0
"As a case study of an S-selection based system in which predicates select complements based on their semantic rather than morpho-syntactic properties, we carry out an investigation of clausal complementation within light verb constructions in Kannada. In particular, we establish that clause-embedding predicates in Kannada follow a three-way semantic distinction that has previously been proposed as a cross-linguistic typological universal by Rochette (1988) and Wurmbrand & Lohninger (2019). We also provide syntactic
analyses for the infinitival and participial complements commonly selected by Kannada light verb predicates. The infinitival complements are shown to be obligatorily restructured arguments to the light verb, while participial complements are analyzed as optionally restructured arguments to the predicate nominal within the light verb construction. In doing so, we argue against the claim that clausal complements to nouns are restricted to adjunct only
status (e.g., Moulton 2009), with our arguments drawing in part upon Grimshaw &
Mester's (1988) Argument Transfer hypothesis in light verb constructions.",0
"This paper deals with the suffix -CIk in Turkish and argues that the suffix -CIk has an augmentative meaning, as well as a diminutive meaning which has been mentioned in the literature extensively. The different meanings of the suffix -CIk are due to two different structures that I propose.  While the structure of the diminutive is made of one single morpheme -CIk, that of the augmentative suffix is composed of two morphemes: -CI and -k. I offer phonotactic and morphological evidence that shows -k has its own life. I also show strict categorical selection properties for the diminutive and augmentative suffix: The augmentative one can only be attached to adjectival bases that express negative orderings. The diminutive -CIk, on the other hand, attaches to nouns. I capture this contrast using the nanosyntax model of spellout.",0

"The central claim of the dissertation is that the syntactic distribution of arguments depends on abstract nominal licensing. All nominals must be (i) assigned a thematic role (Chomsky, 1981) and (ii) licensed via abstract phi-agreement (Chomsky, 2000, 2001); these requirements hold of nominals in every language, including those with no Case or agreement morphology (Vergnaud, 1977; Sigurðsson, 1989; Sheehan & van der Wal, 2018). Languages differ, however, in their functional vocabulary (Borer, 1984), including which heads are able to assign thematic roles and check phi-features. Every language has Voice (Kratzer, 1996), which introduces and assigns a thematic role to agents, but not every language has Appl, which introduces high applicatives (Pylkkänen, 2002, 2008). Similarly, I propose that Voice is a nominal licenser in every language, but Appl (in languages that have it) is not universally a nominal licenser. In languages where Appl is a licenser, such as Kinyarwanda, all high applied arguments will have their phi-features checked; applied arguments will therefore be able to stack or recurse freely in the clause. In those languages where Appl is not a licenser, such as Zulu and Tagalog, applied arguments must compete for licensing by the Voice head; thus only one applied argument will be able to be licensed, precluding the possibility of applicative recursion in the language.


Voice plays a privileged role in nominal licensing in being an obligatory licenser (Levin & Massam, 1985; Rezac, 2011) and in delimiting the licensing domain of the clause, such that all nominals must be licensed within VoiceP. I argue that this domain-delimiting status is not an inherent property of the Voice head but only arises when it is the thematic head that is most local to T. More precisely, then, it is Voice under T which defines the licensing domain of the clause. Voice under T is also special in being able to license two arguments: its external argument and an internal argument. Because of its ability to license two arguments, Voice under T is the locus of transitivity alternations, such as the Agent Voice-Patient Voice alternation in Philippine-type voice languages and the ergative-antipassive alternation in ergative languages, and is also responsible for assigning ergative and accusative Case (Legate, 2014).


While Voice defines licensing domains, events define thematic domains, such that the addition of an event means the addition of a new thematic domain. I demonstrate this using evidence from affixal causative constructions, which languages can form in one of two ways, via (i) the addition of a causer argument (Alexiadou et al., 2006, 2015; Schäfer, 2008; Nie, 2020), or (ii) the addition of a causing event (Harley, 1995, 2013; Pylkkänen, 2008). Languages which allow multiple events in causatives also allow multiple causees, indicating that events define domains of thematic interpretation.",0
"Some models of the morphology-phonology interface take (certain aspects of) morphology and phonology to be computed in the same component of the grammar, simultaneously, including many instantiations of Optimality Theory (McCarthy and Prince 1993a,b, Kager 1996, Hyman and Inkelas 1997, Mascaró 2007, Wolf 2008, i.a.). On the other hand are models that separate morphology from phonology, including Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994) and related models (e.g., Trommer 2001, Bye and Svenonius 2012, Dawson 2017, Rolle 2020), as well as ""subcategorization""-based approaches (Paster 2006, 2009, Yu 2007, i.a.). I undertake a careful study of the order of operations needed to derive the form of finite verbs in the Neo-Aramaic language Turoyo (Jastrow 1993). Two morphophonological phenomena found in Turoyo verbs provide evidence for a separation of morphology from phonology: (i) phonologically-conditioned suppletive allomorphy that is anti-optimizing and surface opaque (reaffirming the findings of Paster 2006); and (ii) phonological displacement of an affix (à la infixation) that is also anti-optimizing and surface opaque, and even more surprisingly, counterbleeds morphological operations in the verbal complex but feeds/bleeds phonological ones. The main conclusion from Turoyo is that exponent choice precedes, and is oblivious to, the regular phonology of the language and considerations of phonological optimization. Turoyo also provides a more general window into a number of issues at the morphology-phonology interface, including cyclicity, the timing of infixation, and constraints on allomorphy.",0
"This work presents the results of a series of acceptability judgment surveys conducted by the Yale GrammaticalDiversity Project (YGDP) between 2015 and 2019.

"This article describes a novel approach to the computational modeling of reduplication. Reduplication is often treated as a stumbling block within finite-state treatments of morphology because they cannot adequately capture the productivity of unbounded copying (total reduplication) and because they cannot describe bounded copying (partial reduplication) without a large increase in the number of states. We provide a comprehensive typology of reduplicative processes and show that an understudied type of finite-state machines, two-way deterministic finite-state transducers (2-way D-FSTs), captures virtually all of them. Furthermore, the 2-way FSTs have few states, are in practice easy to design and debug, and are linguistically motivated in terms of the transducer's origin semantics or segment alignment. Most of these processes, and their corresponding 2-way D-FSTs are available in an online database of reduplication (RedTyp). We classify these 2-way D-FSTs according to the concatenation of known subclasses of regular relations and show that the majority fall into the Concatenated Output Strictly Local (C-OSL) class. Other cases require higher subclasses but are still definable by 2-way D-FSTs.",0
"In many languages with clitic or other weak pronouns, a Person–Case Constraint (PCC) (Perlmutter 1971, Bonet 1991) prohibits certain combinations of these pronouns based on their person features. This paper explores the crosslinguistic variation in such constraints, starting with several closely-related Zapotec varieties. These restrict combinations of clitics based not just on person, but also on a finely articulated largely animacy-based gender system. Operating within a larger combinatorial space, these constraints offer a new perspective on the typology of Phi–Case Constraints (ΦCCs) more generally. This typology has an overall asymmetrical shape correlating with the underlying syntactic position of pronominal arguments. We develop a principled theory of this typology that incorporates three hypotheses: (i) ΦCCs arise from how a functional head Agrees with clitic pronouns, subject to intervention-based locality (Anagnostopoulou 2003, Béjar and Rezac 2003, 2009); (ii) the variation in these constraints arises from variation in the relativization of probes (Anagnostopoulou 2005, Nevins 2007, 2011); and, (iii) clitic and other weak pronouns have no inherent need to be licensed via Agree with a functional head. Under this account, the crosslinguistic typology of ΦCCs has the potential to shed light on the grammatical representation of person and gender.",0

"In this thesis, I investigate the distribution and function(s) of gender in Tunisian
Arabic. Based on the observation that gender can ll multiple functions and hence
receive different interpretations in TA, I consider gender in this language to be subject
to contextual allosemy. Allosemy is the equivalent of conditioned allomorphy at the
level of LF (Wood, 2012; Marantz, 2013;Wood and Marantz, 2017) and is dened as a
phenomenon in which a single morpheme can have multiple semantic realizations. My
proposal is based on the observation that the interpretation of gender is conditioned
by its syntactic environment, more specifically, by the class of the base noun and the
function and interpretation of any node or abstract morpheme (e.g., number) that
is parasitic of the n head hosting the class feature.
The current predominant view of gender in syntactic theory is that it has a
nominalizing function (Lecarme, 2002; Kihm, 2005; Lowenstamm, 2008; Acquaviva,
2009; Kramer, 2009, 2014, 2015; Hammerly, 2018). According to this view, gender
is hosted on the n head, which selects the root, and assigns it a nominal category
(assuming DM). However, Arabic has other uses for the feminine gender, most of
them associated with number. This, I argue, originates from the diachronic trajectory
of the feminine affix -a in Proto-Semitic, where it started out as a nominalizer,
then a singulative affix, then a group marker, before finally marking feminine gender
(Hasselbach, 2014a,b; Dali and Mathieu, 2019a). These subsequent layers of meanings
associated with what is now known as gender are all present in the synchronic
picture of Arabic. Through an exhaustive inventory of data and diagnostics, I show
that the role of gender is pervasive within the Tunisian Arabic DP, and is not limited
to nominalization. To account for these facts, I propose that gender is distributed
among the different functional heads of the DP: Num, Q, D (see also Farkas 1990;
Ritter 1993; Giurgea 2008; Croitor and Giurgea 2009; Steriopolo and Wiltschko 2010;
Fassi Fehri 2012, 2018b,a; Dali and Mathieu 2019a).
The present thesis also focuses on plurals. I show that plural markers can also
be distributed along the nominal spine (Acquaviva, 2008; Harbour, 2008; Wiltschko,
2008, 2012; Butler, 2012; Mathieu, 2012, 2013, 2014; Kramer, 2016), accounting for
their different functions (e.g., classifying, grouping, counting). These different functions
associated with Arabic plurals are, I argue, due to the existence of a singulative
operator that is not limited to the collective system, but is pervasive in Tunisian Arabic,
as I show. Finally, these observations all suggest that one and the same abstract
morpheme (e.g., the feminine and the plural) can receive different interpretations
depending on the base they attach to and on their syntactic level, which motivates
the allosemic analysis put forward in this thesis.",0
"Previous studies overlook the fact that exclamatives (Excls) are temporally deictic to the here and now, and they are anchored by the context rather than Tense (i.e., they lack the TP layer), and that they are constructed crosslinguistically as nonclausal projections. This paper provides an overview of the literature and highlights that the clausal type of Excls is not agreed upon, the defining features (e.g., factivity, scalar implicature, and question/answer relations) are highly controversial and cross-linguistically invalid, and previous analyses seem inconsistent, complicated, and inadequate to account for the idiosyncrasies of Excls. Unlike previous studies, the paper claims that Excls as asymmetrical small clauses selected by Excl head. This analysis accounts for the peculiarities and intricacies of the three types of Arabic Excls (i.e., Wh-Excls, vocative Excls, and verbal Excls) such as (i) their inflexible word order, (ii) case alternation on the referent, (iii) the presence of spurious prepositions, and (vi) the obligatory presence of some particles and affixes although not semantically required. Since the given peculiarities are not specific to Arabic and are found in other languages and supported by cross-linguistic data, the paper claims that the nonsentential approach is empirically more defensible and conceptually simpler to account for Excls crosslinguistically.",0

"Subject agreement in Turkish usually appears verb-finally. However, in
certain cases agreement may appear non-finally. Furthermore, in certain
dialects, and in colloquial speech, agreement may appear both finally and
non-finally, yielding doubling. Previous accounts do not consider double
agreement, and therefore are explanatorily inadequate. This paper proposes
an account in which medial agreement is derived via reduplicating a string of
morphemes that includes agreement, followed by deletion of some of the
duplicate or original morphemes. While medial agreement involves
reduplication plus deletion of one of the occurrences of agreement, I claim
that double agreement involves reduplication but without deletion of the base
or the reduplicant of agreement. My account is an adapted version of the
morphological metathesis accounts that were proposed for double agreement
in Spanish (see Mare 2018 for an overview).",0
"This paper offers a new morphosyntactic account of subject agreement in the Turkish verbal domain. The account is based on well-known, novel, and some excluded observations about the distribution and prosody of verbal agreement. In Turkish, when certain morphosyntactic requirements are met and when the verb is focused, the agreement morpheme can be optionally parsed inside or outside of the prosodically prominent part of the verbal domain. I claim that this optionality is a reflex of how the morphemes that constitute the verbal domain are post-syntactically concatenated. In particular, I argue that an agreement morpheme either lowers together with its host (full lowering); or is stranded when its host lowers (partial lowering). In full lowering, agreement is contained within the prominent part of the verbal domain, whereas in partial lowering, agreement falls outside of this prominence domain. I also show that prosodic variability is observed only when the non-canonical medial and double realization of agreement is possible. The Vocabulary Insertion rules that are postulated for the subject agreement paradigms of the Turkish verbal domain capture the possible cases of medial and double agreement and successfully predict in which environments medial agreement is optional and in which environments it is obligatory.

In another paper that is recently published, I discuss whether or not an alternative analysis, i.e. reduplication plus deletion which was originally suggested for Spanish Agr doubling, works for Turkish medial and double agreement cases.

"Language-specific grammatical analysis has the potential to shed light not only on the language under investigation but on general or universal grammar as well. The goal of this book is to propose and defend positions on a number of current issues in morphology and phonology using data drawn primarily from Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages. The book falls into two parts, the first dealing with the relationship between morphology and syntax and the second with the principles governing morphophonological analysis. Part I adduces evidence that roots and derivational affixes cannot be considered syntactic objects but that stems and inflectional affixes must be. In Part II, ongoing or completed diachronic change in Japanese and Ryukyuan languages provides the crucial evidence that illuminates the synchronic analytic choices of speakers with regard to morphophonology, and data from non-Japonic languages, notably Korean, Portuguese, and Modern Greek, is appealed to as well in proposing principles that can explain those analytic choices.

"This paper presents a novel pattern of ditransitive person restrictions in Caquinte (Arawakan; Peru), where combinations of two local persons are ungrammatical, but non-hierarchical combinations (e.g., 3>local) are permitted. This restriction is obviated by anti-agreement under A'-extraction; as such, we argue that this restriction is entirely morphological, resulting from competition in a verbal template plus a RealizeParticipant constraint which requires overt exponence of local person features. Additionally, Caquinte shows a purely syntactic restriction on local direct objects in the presence of indirect object extraction, which we attribute to a Person Licensing Condition (Béjar & Rezac 2003). The co-occurrence of these two restrictions suggests a modular system of person restrictions: the morphology derives certain types of restrictions, while the syntax derives others.",0
"First, I propose a non-gradual criterion of distinction between derivation and inflection based on a model of the position of morphology in the architecture of the language faculty. According to this model, derivational morphology reflects aspects of the syntactic structure of words (and implies the creation of different words), while inflectional morphology reflects aspects of the syntactic structure of sentences (and implies the creation of different forms of the same word). Next, I propose definitions of the three traditional morphological processes (inflection, derivation and compounding), then show that the problems of delimitation between them do not reveal inconsistencies in the definition of the processes, but rather, problems in the application of the definitions to specific cases, these being grouped as follows: (a) processes that seem inflectional, but are derivational, (b) processes that seem derivational, but are inflectional, and (c) problems of delimitation between derivation and compounding, which have to do with the problems of delimitation between roots and affixes.",0
"This paper presents a finite-state computational model of the verbal morphology of Michif. Michif, the official language of the Métis people, is a uniquely mixed language with Algonquian and French origins. It is spoken across the Métis homelands in Canada and the US, but it is highly endangered with less than 100 speakers. The verbal morphology is remarkably complex, as the already polysynthetic Algonquian patterns are combined with French elements.Li Verbkaa-Ooshitahk di Michif handles this complexity by using a series of composed finite-state transducers to model the concatenative morphology and phonological rule alternations that occur in Michif. Such a rule-based approach is necessary as there is insufficient language data for an approach that uses machine learning. A language model such asLi Verb kaa-Ooshitahk di Michif furthers the goals of Canadian Indigenous computational linguistics while also support-ing the creation of tools for documentation, education, and revitalization that are desired by theMétis community.",0

"I argue that a range of morphological phenomena sensitive to features of multiple arguments in Georgian (South Caucasian) - including Anti-Superiority effects (Bejar 2003), and omnivorous number effects (Nevins 2011) - receive a unified account if spellout targets contiguous spans of maximally simple heads, in a fixed hierarchy. I introduce new data from a related language, Laz, and show that a close comparison of the two languages reveals that (i) number agreement is expressed omnivorously only if the prefix is not sensitive to number, and that (ii) this number expression covaries with Tense only if the subject is third person. I argue that both Anti-Superiority and the facts about number expression should be interpreted as fusional morphology being limited to third person contexts, and that a principled explanation for such an asymmetry can be provided, if first and second person structurally contain third person, and the matching of exponents with syntactic structure is governed by Overspecification (Starke 2009), such that a lexicalized span is a candidate of spellout for its sub-spans.",0
"I argue for the dependent analysis of ergative case in Koryak (Chukotko-Kamchatkan) on the basis of a heretofore unrecognized pattern of interaction between case assignment and successive-cyclic movement. Specifically, I argue that the cross-clausal movement of absolutive wh-phrases triggers dependent case licensing at each stop of successive-cyclic movement along the noun phrase's movement path, which I argue to be [Spec,vP] and [Spec,CP]. The result of this is that nouns along the moving wh-phrase's movement path bear case-marking they would not otherwise have: ergative on otherwise-absolutive subjects, and dative on otherwise-absolutive objects. This provides a novel type of argument both for a dependent account of case marking as well as for intermediate landing sites of wh-movement.",0
"In this squib I demonstrate that there is an explanation of the number marking we see on nouns when they combine with the numeral 'zero' which combines Martí's (2020) account of the morphology and semantics of the numeral+noun construction with Bylinina and Nouwen's (2018) semantics for 'zero' and which does not need to appeal to any further principles (e.g., agreement).",0
"In this paper I lay down the theoretical groundwork for an extension of Martí's (2020) theory of the numeral+noun construction (e.g., English 'three dogs') to languages that draw a distinction between singular, dual and plural in their nominal domain. Martí's account hypothesizes that the number marking we see on nouns in this construction is the result of the interaction between the compositional semantics of number features, as conceived of in Harbour (2014), and of cardinal numerals, as conceived of in Scontras (2014) and others. Extending Martí's account to singular-dual-plural languages makes concrete predictions about the types of number marking we should observe on their nouns when they combine with numerals, and the question that arises is whether these are the patterns that we indeed find cross-linguistically. I argue below that the numeral+noun construction in Yimas and Hopi conforms straightforwardly to these predictions. I also discuss Imere and Ljubljana Slovenian, languages which can be shown to conform to the predictions once a proper understanding of complex numerals (in the case of Ljubljana Slovenian) and number prefixes (in the case of Imere) is in place. The consideration of Ljubljana Slovenian requires an analysis for complex numerals, aspects of which I borrow from Ionin and Matushansky (2006, 2018) and adapt to fit Martí's proposal. The analysis makes additional predictions that remain to be investigated and that are spelled out as well.",0
"Aspectual verbs in Ndebele combine with either a participial or a subjunctive form of the lexical verb. I demonstrate that the choice of embedded morphology in this language correlates with whether the aspectual verb is lexical (selects subjunctive forms) or functional (selects participles). Such a distribution provides an argument for defining participial and subjunctive morphology configurationally, rather than as exponents of features such as [PART] and [SBJV]. In particular, I propose that subjunctive morphology is an exponent of a DEP(endency) feature, assigned to the verb in featurally deficient syntactic contexts. These contexts include selection of V by a featurally unspecified T (subjunctive clauses) or by a lexical aspectual verb.",0
"This paper is concerned with the lexical representation of accentedness - i.e., the property by which certain morphemes attract word-level stress in languages in which its surface distribution is not phonologically predictable. Recent constraint-based approaches to this question diverge in whether a lexical accent is (i) an abstract prominence autosegmentally linked to an input vowel, which is thus preferentially incorporated into metrical structure (Revithiadou 1999, 2007, Alderete 2001, i.a.); or (ii) metrical structure directly pre-specified in the input (Inkelas 1999, Özçelik 2014, i.a.). I argue that only (ii) can account for the distribution of word stress in Vedic Sanskrit (Indic, Indo-European). Crucial evidence for this proposal comes from cases in which an accented vowel is eliminated in the output, which results in an apparent rightward stress shift  (termed ``secondary mobility'' by Kiparsky 2010). I show that only on the metrical analysis is it possible to reconcile these rightward shifts with the phonological preference for left edge stress otherwise observed in the language.",0
"This paper makes a terminological proposal: that the old term ""morph"" (which has mostly fallen out of use) can be used for a minimal linguistic form. Many linguists (not only morphologists) need such a term, because we often refer to minimal linguistic forms, but the various terms used by linguists in roughly this meaning are either unclear or do not refer to forms. The term ""morpheme"" has three rather different meanings, and other terms such as ""vocabulary item"" are too abstract. The term ""morph"" can be used as the basis for defining other widely used terms such as ""root"", ""prefix"", and ""suffix"", which are currently often defined as kinds of ""morphemes"". It can also serve as the basis for a clearer definition of suppletion (involving suppletive morph sets) and morph variants, thus avoiding the confusions surrounding the term ""allomorph(y)"".",0
"Weisser (2019) reanalyzes the Breton rannig, Busan Korean interrogative complementizer alternations, and West-Germanic complementizer agreement as allomorphy instead of agreement, and proposes a set of diagnostics to distinguish allomorphy from agreement. While the cases for Breton and Busan Korean are convincing and the results coherent, West-Germanic complementizer agreement diverges in several respects. In this squib, I review the three case studies and show that the argument for analyzing West-Germanic complementizer agreement as allomorphy does not hold up. In addition, I discuss three new data points on complementizer agreement that cannot be analyzed with a PF account. Accepting that complementizer agreement is not allomorphy allows us to revise the diagnostics to distinguish allomorphy from agreement to a stricter set.",0
"In a language, suffix cohesion refers to the fact that suffixed words behave phonologically as simple or complex units depending on the suffix they are built with. This paper uncovers a previously undescribed pattern of suffix cohesion in French, where words suffixed with vowel- and glide-initial suffixes behave phonologically like simple units (e.g. fêtiez [fet-je] 'you partied') and words built with other consonant-initial suffixes behave phonologically like complex units (e.g. fêterez [fɛt-ʁe] 'you will party'). The evidence comes from a reassessment of well-known data on [ə]-[ɛ] stem alternations and from an acoustic study of [e]-[ɛ] and [o]-[ɔ] alternations in suffixed words as pronounced by 10 speakers living in the Paris area. The suffix's phonological shape is found to provide the best account of the data among a set of factors that have been argued to be relevant to suffix cohesion in other languages (in particular resyllabification). The French pattern has important theoretical implications for theories of suffix cohesion as it is not prosodically conditioned. An alternative analysis in terms of paradigm uniformity is proposed, where suffixed words are treated as complex units phonologically if the suffix's phonological shape facilitates the perceptual recognition of the base corresponding to the suffixed word's stem.",0
"This paper identifies a type of noun incorporation in which the verb and a nominal are combined as early saturation of the verb, in contrast to early restriction, which is seen in the familiar type of noun incorporation. Two types of V-V resultative constructions in Mandarin Chinese are compared: the agent-oriented one and the patient-oriented one. The semantic grouping effects of the first verb and the post-verbal nominal of an agent-oriented type show that they are local to each other in their base-positions. But unlike in the patient-oriented one, the first verb in the construction shows a weak reachability. The defectiveness of the verb is parallel to that of an incorporated nominal in the familiar type of noun incorporation: e.g., no modification and no anaphoric linking to a proform. The paper argues that the first verb in the agent-oriented resultative construction and the post-verbal nominal, which can be a full-fledged referential nominal, undergo a type of noun incorporation parallel to the familiar type. In such noun incorporation, instead of the nominal, it is the verb that exhibits root-like properties. Such properties are viewed as a consequence of an early combination of a verb and a nominal, before each of them takes an event-argument, in a neo-Davisonian semantic perspective.",0
"The paper discusses a three-way allomorphic pattern of neuter-gender
stems in Czech. We argue that there are two surface alternations involved in the
three-stem pattern, i.e. a-e and t-zero, and that the two alternations are driven by
two distinct mechanisms, i.e. suppletion and regular phonological computation
respectively. We postulate two suppletive stem-building suffixes that are lexically
connected via the Nanosyntactic tool of pointers. We argue that the default a-initial
suffix spells out the neuter gender and its suppletive e-initial variant is a portmanteau morpheme of the (neuter) gender and (singular) number. We further
propose that the suppletive suffix is stored with a floating consonant that does not
surface word-finally due to regular phonological computation.",0
"Natural languages contain complex grammatical patterns. For example, in German, embedded clauses have subjects first and verbs final, while main clauses have the verb second and allow any topicalized constituent to be first (V2 word order). Children acquire V2 patterns remarkably early, motivating claims that they fully represent the abstract structure of their language (e.g. Poeppel & Wexler, 1993). However, in order to represent patterns in an abstract way, learners must first notice the patterns, raising the possibility that these patterns are-at least initially-all the learner knows. I explore the possibility that learners begin acquiring morphosyntax by identifying and correlating concrete surface patterns. On this account, statistical patterns-not abstract tree structures-are the main content of learners' early morphosyntactic representations. I use a miniature language paradigm, where learners' knowledge can be carefully probed to distinguish different types of representations. In Experiment 1, I show that adults easily learn V2 patterns without representing the language's full structure, refuting claims that V2 patterns are too complex to learn and demonstrating that knowledge of patterns is possible without abstract structural representations. In Experiments 2-4, I explore constraints on this pattern-learning mechanism by manipulating the miniature language's morphology and measuring changes in learning of V2 patterns. V2 patterns were learned only when the language had V2 morphology, a universal property of natural V2 languages. Taken together, these results suggest that adults have access to a robust pattern-learning mechanism that operates quickly, does not require full linguistic representations, and is most effective under typologically natural conditions. This mechanism has the right properties to play an important role in the early stages of child language acquisition.",0
"This paper is devoted to the phenomenon of partial concord. Partial concord in a feature F is a situation when the noun phrase contains an element distinct from the head noun (e.g. a cardinal numeral or a determiner) such that modifiers c-commanding this element always realize F, while modifiers c-commanded by this element only realize F if the element itself does not. The paper assumes that this element introduces F into the noun phrase structure and calls it the locus of F. The paper argues that two well known morpho-syntactic phenomena, which have been previously treated in different ways, both fall under the same generalization and constitute a single phenomenon: partial concord. These are the lack of Number marking in noun phrases with cardinal numerals in Estonian and some other languages and the strong vs. weak distinction in adjectival paradigms in German and Icelandic. The former phenomenon is captured as partial concord in Number and the latter phenomenon is captured as partial concord in Case. The paper puts forward a theory that derives partial concord building on the feature realization mechanism from Schlenker (1999) and the rule of feature deletion from Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1993). Building on Bayırlı (2017), the paper proposes two cross-linguistic parameters that determine whether a language has full concord, partial concord or no concord in a given feature.",0
"This dissertation investigates the correspondences between syntactic, prosodic, and metrical constituents in Blackfoot (Algonquian), a polysynthetic language. I propose that the syntax-prosody correspondence is distinct from the alignment of prosodic and metrical structure. In a parallel constraint-based model of phonology, this predicts that a language might satisfy isomorphic syntax-prosody correspondence at the expense of prosodic and metrical alignment, or vice versa. To determine the generalizations in Blackfoot, I gathered data by conducting fieldwork with speakers and consulting published reference materials. Some arguments in the dissertation are based on original morphological and phonological analyses of Blackfoot stems. 

For the syntax-prosody correspondence, I hypothesize that each syntactic phase corresponds to a particular prosodic constituent by default. Specifically, the vP phase (the predicate of events), matches to a Prosodic Word (PWd) constituent, and the DP and CP phases match to Phonological Phrase (PPh) constituents. I model these relationships using a modified version of Match Theory (Selkirk 2011), where mismatches between syntactic phases and prosodic structure only occur in order to satisfy prosodic wellformedness constraints. For the relation between prosody and metrical structure, I hypothesize that the edges of metrical constituents align to different prosodic constituents (prosodic word, phonological phrase, or intonational phrase). 

Regarding structure in Blackfoot, I argue that a constraint which requires sister nodes within the prosodic structure to be of the same type outranks the syntax-prosody MATCH constraints. This forces each DP argument and also the remainder of the CP (e.g. the verbal complex) to be matched to a PPh constituent. The vP phase and every higher vP projection corresponds to a PWd constituent, which is distinct from the PPh. I argue that the metrical constituents in Blackfoot align to PPh edges, and that syllables frequently span PWd edges. This is a predicted outcome, given that the MATCH and ALIGN constraints are violable. The model I propose accounts for the correspondence relations in Blackfoot, and leads to a typology of predicted language types, with implications for extending Match Theory to account for polysynthetic languages.",0
"There is a long tradition in linguistics implicating child language acquisition as a major driver of language change, the classic intuition being that innovations or ""errors"" which emerge during the acquisition process may occasionally propagate through through speech communities and accumulate as change over time. In order to better understand this relationship, I establish new methods for reasoning about language acquisition in the past. I demonstrate that certain aspects of child linguistic experience may be reasonably estimated from historical corpora and employ a quantitative model of productivity learning to investigate the role acquisition played as the driver of four well-documented instances of phonological, syntactic, and morphological change: transparent /aɪ/-raising in modern North American English, the innovation and lexical spread of the to-dative in Middle English, the analogy of the lengthened *ē-grade in Proto-Germanic strong verbs, and the forms of the past participles and t-deverbals in Classical and Late Latin. These case studies provide new insights into the implications of sparsity and variation on the first language acquisition process, the role that acquisition plays as the actuator of community-level change, and the complementary nature of acquisition and diachronic evidence for synchronic representation.",0
"The notion that human language involves a ""computational procedure"" is widely used in Minimalist syntactic theorizing (and Chomskian versions of generative syntax more generally), but can be confusing to philosophers, psychologists and linguists who come from a different perspective. This article sketches out why Minimalist syntax takes concepts from the theory of computation to be relevant to syntactic theory and why the notion of a computational procedure can be understood as a central component of tacit knowledge of language. It teases out six distinct issues: (i) the nature of the computational device; (ii) the nature of the computational procedure; (iii) the memory structure of the device; (iv) the nature of the symbolic material processed by the device; (v) the relationship between the abstract function computed and the concrete procedure that is run; (vi) how the notion of computation is to be understood as distinct from computing parses etc. (the difference between knowledge of syntax and use of that knowledge). It then briefly explores the implications that taking computational issues seriously might have for the explanatory potential of Minimalist syntax.",0
This paper provides a new explanation of why German alle seine Freunde 'all his friends' is grammatical but alle Peters Freunde 'all Peter's friends' is not. It also discusses the contrast between the grammatical alle diese Freunde 'all these friends' and the marked alle die Freunde 'all the friends'.,0
"Uspanteko is one of the smallest and most threatened Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala. While Uspanteko belongs to the K'ichean branch of the Mayan family, it bears a striking number of linguistic features not seen in its sister languages, across major aspects of the grammar, including phonetics/phonology (i.e., lexical tone) and morphosyntax (i.e., null verbal inflection). After introducing an Uspanteko text about the sacred hill Xoqoneb' and placing it in its cultural context, including surveying related Uspanteko texts, we use Xoqoneb' to illustrate those aspects of the Uspanteko language which stand out relative to other K'ichean languages. We also comment on the possible sources of these divergent features, which include both language contact and innovation.",0
"This paper discusses differences between two prenominal possessive constructions in Yiddish: the familiar mayn bruder 'my brother' and the less well-known mayner a bruder 'a brother of mine'. It is shown that the first construction is definite and that the second one is indeed indefinite. The discussion is extended to eyner 'one' and epes 'some', which can also precede an indefinite article. Considering that these three pre-determiner elements (possessive pronominal, eyner, and epes) can be ""stacked"" and switch positions, it is argued that the second construction involves adjunction to DP. The overall conclusion is that Yiddish prenominal possessives adhere to Definiteness Spread. On a different note, this paper contains a lot of new, unexpected data that should be of interest to anyone working on the DP.",0

"This paper has as its central concern the proposition in Marantz (1987) that Bracketing Paradoxes (BP) have deep implications for the (in)correctness of certain proposals within the domain of generative phonology. Where it differs from Marantz' account, and from every previous account of BPs is in the absence of an appeal to ad-hoc tools to eliminate the paradoxical derivations. It is argued herein that a theory in which phonological representations are limited to linear strings (no Prosodic Hierarchy), and where phonological operations must be triggered via phonological means (no Level-specific morphological diacritics) that Bracketing Paradoxes cease to exist. The necessary conclusion arising from this analysis is that problematic derivations like BPs signal important flaws in our theoretical proposals.",0
Spanish 'ir' ('go') has unexpected f-initial forms in the preterite and in the imperfect subjunctive. Rather than being suppletive forms of 'ir' they are forms of 'ser' ('be'). The interpretative contribution of 'go' is provided by the presence of a silent GO. The syntax of silent verbs turns out to be of importance to what appear to be traditional questions of morphology.,0
"This paper develops a new approach to a family of hierarchy effect-inducing configurations, with a focus on Person Case Constraint (PCC) effects, dative-nominative configurations, and copula constructions. The main line of approach in the recent literature is to attribute these effects to failures of phi-Agree or, more specifically, failures of nominal licensing or case checking. We propose that the problem in these configurations is unrelated to nominal licensing, but is instead the result of a probe participating in more than one Agree dependency, a configuration we refer to as feature gluttony. Feature gluttony does not in and of itself lead to ungrammaticality, but rather can create irresolvably conflicting requirements for subsequent operations. We argue that in the case of clitic configurations, a probe which agrees with more than one DP creates an intervention problem for clitic-doubling. In violations involving morphological agreement, gluttony in features may result in a configuration with no available morphological output.",0
"We investigate the morphological marking of two different types of cardinals across various languages. We argue that it is possible to identify cross-linguistically stable semantic ingredients, which compositionally provide the correct meaning for the two types of numerals. We adopt the framework of Nanosyntax (Starke 2009 et seq.) as a model of morphology which, when applied to the semantic structures we propose, delivers the relevant marking patterns.",1
"The aim of this dissertation is an analysis of agreement in
relation to genitival constructions. It proposes that the Apulian
non-prepositional genitives of San Marco in Lamis can be described
as regulated by a definiteness agreement mechanism manifesting
itself in the necessity of articled heads (excluding vocatives)
and genitival nouns, coupled with an adjacency requirement which
limits the realization of post-nominal modifiers of the head in a
post-genitival position, where they might only refer to the
genitive noun. This work thus proposes that such agreement for
definiteness is the same holding in Romanian non-al genitives
which result in the linker construction when agreement is
disrupted. In chapter 1 we thus introduce Kartvelian genitives by
Suffixaufnahme which notoriously represent a genitive-head noun
morphological agreement phenomenon. Plank (1995) also shows that
in a series of genitives, Suffixaufnahme shows up only on the last
one, demonstrating that when it comes to agreement in genitives,
local dynamics of sorts are often at stake (as it happens with
the Costruct State). In 2 we move to linkers; linkers have been
connected to agreement in Suffixaufnahme genitives at least since
Plank (1995) and later works such as Larson and Yamakido (2006),
Manzini et al (2016), and Manzini (2018), according to which
linkers can be assimilated to agreement. In fact, in synthetic
systems such as Romanian and Aromanian, Albanian and Arbëresh,
and Kurdish varieties, linkers agree for φ with either the head
or the genitive noun. Giurgea and Dobrovie-Sorin (2013: 126)
further show that in Romanian non-linker constructions possessives
agree for case with the head noun. In linker constructions,
agreement for case is not present: it's the linker itself which
agrees with the head noun, this time of course for φ. Chapter 3
deals with genitival modification in Hebrew and a number of Arabic
varieties. It proposes that the pseudoprepositions found in Arabic
varieties are nouns in the Construct State. This was previously
proposed for Palestinian Arabic in Mohammad (1999), which also
shows that such elements agree for φ with the modified noun. 3.2
takes into account the Semitic preposition l-, dealing with the
question of whether this element can be characterized as
possessive and locative as it happens for Romance a. 4 analyzes
Apulian non-prepositional genitives and proposes as anticipated
that the necessity of articled nouns in the construction is to be
linked to an agreement relation taking place via D. Lastly, 5
subsumes the conclusions of this work.",1
"Despite their apparent simplicity, the structure of DPs containing
``complement'' CPs (what we will call DCs) has long been obscure. One major strand of investigation has attempted to assimilate DCs to (close) nominal apposition, implying that N and CP form a structural unit which then combines with D. Danish has two kinds of DCs, a bare DC with the superficial structure 
[D N CP] and a prepositional DC in which the CP is encased in a PP. Exploiting clues provided by the allomorphy of the definite morpheme, we argue that the bare and prepositional DCs have very different structures, neither of which can be assimilated toapposition between N and CP.  We further show that the two kinds of DC have distinct semantic and pragmatic properties. We then argue that English also has two different structures for DCs, and that they are plausibly parallel to the structures we establish for Danish. We conclude by arguing that
two distinct structures give rise to the ``apposition'' relation: in one case it is between coarguments of D and in the other it is nonrestrictive composition.",0
"This paper studies the morpho-syntax of proper names like Deutsche Bank 'German bank' in German. It is shown that these types of proper names, called derived proper names here, are lexically frozen and depending on the phenomenon, are morpho-syntactically frozen or transparent. To capture these hybrid properties, it is proposed that the elements to be merged in the derivation are taken from a stored set in the lexicon. Second, these elements form a CHAIN during the syntactic derivation. More complex cases are discussed in the context of German and Norwegian. Given this discussion, it seems unlikely that referentiality is located in the DP-level.",0
"This article provides initial evidence that the head K, which may spell out as case morphology, drives the operations of concord within the noun phrase. Evidence for this claim comes from three code-switching varieties: Basque/Spanish, German/Turkish and Russian/Kazakh. By placing the switch at the border between case morphology and the rest of the noun phrase the properties of K can be isolated and inspected. We find that if K is drawn from the lexicon of a non-concord language, constituents within the noun phrase adopt a default morphology. It is suggested that the data presented in this paper provide evidence for approaches that take Concord to be a form of Agree (probe,goal) and against an approach that takes it to be the result of feature percolation from the bottom up. An analysis of default morphology is proposed that argues that default forms are inserted as vocabulary items in syntactic terminals that, as a result of a failure of Agree, are populated with unvalued features.",1
"We discuss a cross-linguistically rare pattern of comparative formation found in Slovak. This pattern is theoretically interesting, because it violates a candidate universal on the relationship between the positive and the comparative degree. The universal, discussed recently in Grano and Davis (2018), says that the comparative is always either identical to, or derived from the positive degree. This universal is violated by a number of adjectives in Slovak. These adjectives have a  suffix in the positive degree, which is absent in the comparative. We capture this pattern in terms of a non-containment structure of the positive and the comparative degrees and the nanosyntax model of spellout (Starke 2009 et seq.).",1

"This dissertation is on the tonal system of nouns in Nuer, a Western Nilotic language. Tone in Nuer is an understudied topic and has mostly been ignored in previous studies. This dissertation demonstrates that tone has a primary role in nominal morpho-phonology involving tonal interactions of three components: lexical tone, L tone restrictions, and inflectional tone. I offer a stratal OT analysis of this based on a new assumption of bidirectional affectiveness.
The empirical parts of this dissertation give evidence of tone in Nuer and its phonetic cues.",0
"Latin verbs appear to both obey and disobey the Mirror Generalization (Baker 1985), albeit in different inflectional forms (Cinque 1999). Given the importance of the Mirror Generalization to morphosyntactic theorizing, this situation deserves scrutiny. We develop an analysis on which all Latin finite verbs, whether mirroring or anti-mirroring, share a single, simple, virtually invariant derivation, involving one step of head movement (Asp to T) and one step of phrasal movement (vP to [Spec,TP]). On this analysis, the Mirror Generalization is valid for Latin, despite appearances, but it is crucially about structures formed by operations on heads: phrasal movement can give rise to apparent violations of it (Myler 2017). The analysis extends readily to nonfinite forms, solving an anti-mirroring paradox arising among the participles. It also makes correct syntactic predictions. When the verb word is a constituent, it is a TP, and the analysis correctly predicts that it should move as a phrase, not as a head. The analysis also makes correct predictions about the positions of vP-adjuncts, and is fully compatible with what is known about leftward argument movement out of vP. Finally, unlike two competing analyses (Embick 2000; Calabrese 2019), it accounts for anti-mirroring in Latin without any stipulations placing passive Voice in an unexpectedly peripheral position within the verb word. The larger picture that emerges is one in which phonological words need not correspond to syntactic constituents, but can instead be reflexes of linearly contiguous series of morphemes suspended across potentially vast regions of syntactic space (Julien 2002).",0
"In this paper I offer an analysis of unusual temporal semantics of Pirahã. At the time that this was published, I felt that grammar should affect culture rather than the other way around. However, since abandoning the idea of ""parametrization"" in grammars (as well as Chomskyanism in general) and through incorporating what is known about tense with other aspects of Pirahã grammar, it has become clear that it is culture affecting grammar that is most significant in Pirahã, rather than the other way around (wrt tense). This paper assumed a Hornsteinian interpretation of Reichenbach's classic work on tense, but parameterized so as to omit the ""R"" point. In current work I am incorporating this into a wider theory of temporal semantics based on Peircean semiosis. I am posting this article on LingBuzz at the moment because the facts are interesting for theories of temporal representation and interpretation in language.",0
"Cross-linguistically, numerically-quantified expressions vary in terms of their internal syntactic structure (e.g. the category of the numeral, its position in the nominal projection) as well as interaction with the external syntax (e.g. occurring in the subject positions, determining agreement and concord). Here, I investigate Polish numerically-quantified expressions of the 5+ type, such as pięć czarownic 'five witches', focusing on three morphosyntactic properties: the genitive case on the quantified noun, the accusative case on the numeral, and the occurrence of 3sg neuter verbal agreement. I argue that all of these properties can be captured within existing theories of case and agreement, in terms of a null head that takes the quantified noun phrase as its complement, and a numeral phrase as its specifier. Genitive on the noun is structural, accusative on the numeral is licensed by a null preposition, and default agreement is a result of the case-discriminating nature of verbal agreement. This proposal has implications for the broader theory of agreement and case assignment in Slavic languages and beyond.",1
"New title:
Voice at the Interfaces: The syntax, semantics and morphology of the Hebrew verb

This monograph presents the most comprehensive description and analysis to date of Hebrew morphology, with an emphasis on the verbal templates. My aim is to develop a theory of argument structure alternations which is anchored in the syntax but has systematic interfaces with the phonology and the semantics. Concretely, I argue for a specific formal system centered around possible values of the head Voice.

The formal assumptions are as similar as possible to those made in work on non-Semitic languages. The first part of the book (four chapters) is devoted to Hebrew; the second part (two chapters) compares the current theory with other approaches to Voice and argument structure in the recent literature.",0

"This article discusses and analyzes an unusual construction in Icelandic, with a plural pronoun in the singular reading and a directly juxtaposed or annexed NP (or DP), where, for example, við Ólafur (literally ""we.NOM Olaf.NOM"") means 'Olaf and I'. We refer to this construction as Pro[NP]. Pro[NP] constructions have been reported for a handful of languages that lack a case system. Icelandic, in contrast, is a case language, and Pro[NP] in this language is case congruent: the pronoun and its NP/DP annex are always in the same case. No such language has to our knowledge ever been described in detail before; we provide the first in-depth investigation of case-congruent Pro[NP]. The article further compares the Icelandic construction to apparently similar constructions, including English we linguists and the Russian type of Pro[x-NP], as in my s Petej (literally ""we.NOM with Peter.INSTR""), meaning 'Peter and I', showing that the Icelandic construction differs from these, despite having similar (but not identical) semantic properties. We propose that plural personal pronouns consist of two parts: a set of variables, {X, Y}, that determine the form of the pronoun, and an NP annex, which constrains the interpretation of the Y variable. Typically, the annex is phonetically silent (bare plural pronouns), but the Icelandic construction is unusual in that the annex is partly overt, thereby allowing a rare insight into the construction of plural personal pronouns.",1
"How do speakers learn the social meaning of different linguistic variants, and what factors influence how likely a particular social–linguistic association is to be learned? It has been argued that the social meaning of more salient variants should be learned faster, and that learners' pre-existing experience of a variant will influence its salience.  In this paper we report two artificial-language-learning experiments investigating this. Each experiment involved two language learning stages followed by a test. The first stage introduced the artificial language and trained participants in it, while the second stage added a simple social context using images of cartoon aliens. The first learning stage was intended to establish participants' experience with the artificial language in general and with the distribution of linguistic variants in particular. The second stage, in which linguistic stimuli were accompanied by images of particular aliens, was intended to simulate the acquisition of linguistic variants in a social context. In our first experiment we manipulated whether a particular linguistic variant, associated with one species of alien in the second learning phase, had been encountered in the first learning phase. In the second experiment we manipulated whether the variant had been encountered in the same grammatical context. In both cases we predicted that the unexpectedness of a new variant or a new grammatical context for an old variant would increase the variant's salience and facilitate the learning of its social meaning. This is what we found, although in the second experiment, the effect was driven by better learners. Our results suggest that unexpectedness increases the salience of variants and makes their social distribution easier to learn, deepening our understanding of the role of individual language experience in the acquisition of sociolinguistic meaning.",0
"Phonological words play a crucial role in phonology, but where exactly they are produced in syntax is not clear. I propose a theory whereby the syntax issues phonological word diacritics to the complex constituents it creates. Additionally, certain morphemes can be specified in the lexicon as possessing these diacritics. The phonology then interprets the diacritics-sometimes it ignores them, and other times, it makes phonological words to satisfy language-specific prosodic requirements. The resulting theory is demonstrated on the complex patterning of prepositions in Russian. The class of prepositions in Russian has certain syntactic traits in common, but there are many patterns where prepositions diverge according to their phonological word status. There are correlations between morphosyntactic structure and phonological word status: morphologically complex prepositions are always words. On the other hand, the presence of a morphological root, phonological size, and stress do not align with word status. The large range of phonological and morphosyntactic patterns involving prepositions in Russian demonstrates the need for an explicit and rich theory of word formation at the phonology-syntax interface.",0
"In this article it is argued that the selection of allomorphs is distributed over two modules, viz. Vocabulary Insertion and Phonology. This is done on the basis of a case study of vowel length alternating allomorphs in Dutch. The data show a split pattern: some empirical domains can be fully captured by phonological principles. For these cases, the phonologically most optimal allomorph will be selected. In other empirical domains, phonological principles still account for many of the attested data. Yet, one attests lexicalised exceptions as well, which are clearly phonologically non-optimal. The data echo opposing views in the literature: some proposals attempt to reduce allomorph selection to phonology, others focus on the fact that many examples are simply not phonologically optimal and suggest that allomorph selection should not be done by Phonology. I argue that the opposing nature of these two types of data is actually indicative of the way the selection of allomorphs is organised. More specifically, both Vocabulary Insertion and Phonology can determine the selection of allomorphs. Vocabulary Insertion is responsible for stored information, Phonology is responsible for phonologically optimising patterns.",0
"Word order, case assignment, and agreement for gender and number are realised with remarkable complexity in the Arabic numeral system. This paper examines the internal morphological structure of simplex, compound, and complex numerals. We identify a recurrent pattern found both inside complex numerals and in the structural relations between numeral and the nouns they quantify. The structures uncovered then allow for more principled accounts of the superficial morphosyntactic complexities. The analysis suggests that DP contains a single Num head, but that Num can express both additive and multiplicative arithmetic operations.",0
"This paper investigates the phenomenon of 'classificatory verbs', i.e., a set of verbs whose stems alternate to categorize the verbal arguments with regard to animacy, shape, material consistency, etc. Similar to equivalent verbs in other Dene languages, Tłı̨chǫ classificatory verbs are shown to belong to four semantic classes that do not have the same stem inventories or consistent patterns of stem selection. Based on various pieces of evidence, viz., optionality of the classified argument, argument saturation, verbal augmentation, verb-noun correspondence, referentiality, and noun incorporation, the paper argues against the maintenance of the notion that the so-called verb stem is a verbal element; instead, it is a root that merges with a nominalizer to form a nominal affix. In the light of this argument, the paper extends the analysis to non-classificatory verbs claiming a conceptually simpler and computationally more economical analysis of Tłı̨chǫ verbal morphology within the minimalist approach.",0
"Arabic exceptive constructions involve an intricate interaction among word order, negation, and case assignment resulting from syntactic restrictions imposed on the argumental, appositional, and adjunctive functions of exceptive phrases. The morphosyntactic complexities in Arabic exceptives cast doubt on the adequacy of previous analyses that exceptive particles are prepositions, focal adverbs, or coordinating conjunctions, and they also lead the paper to argue for more principled accounts in which exceptive particles are analyzed as functional heads that project into an ExP 'exceptive phrase' which exists in two distinct configurations. The first includes an exceptive marker carrying [Acc-Case] 'accusative case' and [DS] 'domain subtraction' features when the ExP is an adjunct introduced by late Merge. The second includes a negative determiner which selects and c-commands the exceptive particle and deactivates/ suspends its [Acc-Case], consequently, the case feature of the ExP-complement is valued by percolation from D which combines with the exceptive marker to form a discontinuous focus particle with a [DR] 'domain restriction' feature.",0
"Despite displaying identical exponents (a reflexive clitic, imperfective tenses and agreement between the verb and the preverbal definite DP theme), change-of-state predicates in generic/middle contexts (inchoative middles, henceforth), can in fact have two different underlying representations: (i) a generic inchoative and (ii) a generic se-passive, this being the only one projecting a Voice head passivized by the reflexive clitic, which denotes an implicit generic external argument. Spanish allows the insertion of an affected applicative head in inchoative configurations (Cuervo 2003), which introduces an unselected dative argument interpreted either as an unintentional causer of the event if merged above the verbalizing head, or as affectee if merged below it. Crucially, this paper shows that the generic passive configuration disallows the applicative's unintentional causer interpretation, since the position above vP is already filled by Voice; therefore, the only available merging position for the applicative is below vP. However, the unintentional causer interpretation is possible in generic inchoative constructions, which lack a VoiceP. The data and analysis presented here support Wood and Marantz's (2017) proposal of a single argument-introducing head whose category and interpretation vary in terms of the syntactic context it is merged in. Finally, this study stresses the need to establish a more detailed classification of Spanish se-constructions as a whole and middles in particular with respect to their interaction with applied arguments.",0
"This paper investigates the morphosyntax of an under-studied existential construction in Inuktitut and explores its broader ramifications for noun incorporation in the language. In this construction, a participial verb undergoes noun incorporation into the verb 'HAVE', while the nominal pivot of the existential surfaces with oblique case morphology. I argue that 'HAVE' embeds (i.e. takes as its complement) a Small Clause consisting of the nominal pivot as the subject and the participle as the predicate. Finally, although the incorporation of participles rather than nouns in Inuit is seemingly exceptionally limited to this particular existential construction, I show that it follows straightforwardly from an analysis of incorporation based on complementation.",1
"One motivation for Universal Grammar (UG) is that it's what allows children to acquire the linguistic knowledge that they do as quickly as they do from the data that's available to them.  One key legacy of Chomsky's work in language acquisition is highlighting the separation between children's hypothesis space of possible representations (typically defined by UG) and how children might navigate that hypothesis space (sometimes defined by UG). While statistical learning is sometimes thought to be at odds with UG, I review how statistical learning can both complement UG and help us refine our ideas about the contents of UG. I first review some cognitively-plausible statistical learning mechanisms that can operate over a predefined hypothesis space, like those UG creates. I then review two sets of examples: (i) those where statistical learning allows more efficient navigation through a UG-defined hypothesis space, and (ii) those where statistical learning can replace prior UG proposals for navigating a hypothesis space, and in turn lead to new ideas about how UG might construct the hypothesis space in the first place. I conclude with a brief discussion of how we might make progress on understanding language acquisition by incorporating statistical learning into our UG-based acquisition theories.",0

"Words in polysynthetic languages, such as the Australian language Wubuy, can be semantically complex and translate into whole phrases in analytic languages such as English. This raises questions about whether such words are like words in English, or whether they are more like phrases. In the following, we examine Wubuy speakers' knowledge of word-internal morphological complexity in a word-preference task, in which we test the acceptability of complex words into which artificial pauses have been embedded at a range of morphological junctures. The results show that participants prefer unmodified words and words with pauses inserted at semantically transparent morphological junctures over words with pauses at other junctures. There is no preference for unmodified words over words with pauses at transparent junctures. These results suggest that speakers have access to some word-internal morphological information, and that complex words may share characteristics of both words and phrases in, for instance, English.",0

"Across a large part of Asia are found a variety of verb-verb collocations, a prominent subset of which involves collocations typically displaying completive or resultative semantics. Such collocations are found in Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages of South Asia, Turkic and Iranian languages of Central Asia, and in Chinese languages.

In South and Central Asian languages, verb-verb collocations usually involve some added aspectual/Aktionsart element of meaning, frequently (though not exclusively) indicating completion of an event and sometimes involving speaker evaluation of the event (e.g., surprise, regret). Thus Hindi Rām-ne kitāb paṛh diyā, literally ""John read-gave the book,"" with the sense ""John read the book out."" In Chinese languages, many verb-verb collocations involve a resultative sense, similar to English ""Kim ran herself/her shoes ragged."" However, earlier Chinese verb-verb collocations were agent-oriented, for example, She-sha Ling Gong""(Someone) shot and killed Duke Ling,"" where she is ""shoot"" and sha is ""kill.""

In Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, and Central Asian languages, we find verb-verb collocations that evolve from idiomaticization and grammaticalization of constructions involving converbs, for example, a collocation meaning ""he, having eaten food, left"" acquires the meaning ""he ate food (completely)."" Similarly, the Chinese verb-verb resultatives derive from earlier verb-verb ""co-ordinate"" constructions (originally with an overt morpheme er: ji er sha zhi ""struck and killed him""), which functionally is similar to the role of converbs in South and Central Asian languages.

While these Asian verb-verb collocations are strikingly similar in broad strokes, there are significant differences in the lexical, semantic, and morphosyntactic properties of these constructions in different languages. This is true even in closely related languages in the same language family, such as in Hindi and Nepali.

The historical relation between verb-verb collocations in different Asian languages is unclear. Even in geographically proximate language families such as Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, there is evidence of independent development of verb-verb collocations, with possible later convergence. Central Asian verb-verb collocations being very similar in morphosyntactic structure to South Asian verb-verb collocations, it is tempting to suppose that for these there is some contact-based cause, particularly since such collocations are much less prominent in Turkic and Iranian languages outside of Central Asia. The relation between South and Central Asian verb-verb collocations and Chinese verb-verb collocations is even more opaque, and there are greater linguistic differences here. In this connection, further study of verb-verb collocations in Asian languages geographically intermediate to Central and South Asia, including Thai, Vietnamese, and Burmese, is required.",0
"One feature of modern Indo-Aryan [IA] languages – and South Asian languages more generally – is the employment of verb-verb compounds, which involve collocations of two verbs, where one (the ``light'' or ``vector'' verb) acts as a grammaticalised version of its full verb counterpart. Thus, the verb GO in many IA languages can appear as a light verb in verb-verb [VV] compounds, contributing various more functional semantic components including completion.

Although VV compounds are a clear areal feature of South Asia, at lower levels of analysis we find obvious and substantial differences in the structure, interpretation, and frequency of use of VVs across South Asia, including significant differences even between closely related languages. Hindi VVs occur in a more restricted range of contexts , while VVs in Nepali and Marathi are less restricted. The strength of restrictions on licensed environments for VVs appears to co-vary with the frequency of occur of VVs overall. Thus Hindi VVs appear to display an overall greater frequency of occurrence than do Nepali VVs.

In this chapter, I discuss the historical development and properties of VV compounds in IA, with  reference to VVs in Dravidian. Also notable is discussion of VVs in Sinhala, including early Sinhala.",0

"In this paper we discuss the so-called participle-nominalization polysemy, that is, cases in which the suffix involved in (deverbal) nominalizations is form-identical to the suffix employed in non-finite (typically prenominal) participial relative clauses in Udmurt (Uralic). A shared suffix between (participial) relatives and nominalizations is cross-linguistically widespread, for instance, it is frequently observed in Uralic, Altaic and Tibeto-Burman languages. We lay out the hypothesis space for an explanatory account of the cross-linguistic participle-nominalizer polysemy, and discuss which of the hypotheses is best suited to capture the Udmurt facts in particular. We discuss three ways of unifying participles and nominalizations: (a) the shared suffix is verbal and nominalizations involve mixed projections, (b) the shared suffix is verbal, but nominalizations are in fact relative clauses modifying a covert noun and (c) the shared suffix is nominal, thus, relative clauses are nominalized. We show that the Udmurt suffix -m is employed in relative clauses and deverbal nouns which correspond to verbal gerunds and result nouns. We argue that the suffix is verbal rather than nominal. We analyze relative clauses as bare participial modifiers and gerunds as mixed projections. In the case of result nouns, we propose that these are (reduced) relative clauses with a covert head noun.",0
"This article is an attempt to unify tools for linguistic analysis across modules (in particular for syntax and phonology).
We propose that linguistic representations have two types of primitives: syntactic and phonological items (of the X, XP, feature sort in syntax, and of the feature, segment, syllable, foot sort in phonology) on the one hand, and forces operating on those primitives on the other hand. In this article, we focus on features.

"The particular position of the head in a phrase correlates with a wide range of syntactic properties. Mutually exclusive subsets of these properties characterize head-final ('OV'), head-initial ('VO') or 'freely positioning' ('third type') languages. The linearization of the head is a function of a category-specific directionality value. 

The interaction of the parametric directionality property of lexical heads with the cross-linguistically invariant directionality property of phrases (right-branching) accounts for major syntactic differences between OV-, VO-, and T3 languages. Analogous effects are located in properties of morphological structuring.",0

"This paper provides an account of allomorphy in the domain of verbal number in Georgian (Kartvelian). Cross-linguistically, verbal number is often associated with either suppletion, reduplication, or a combination of the two (Veselinova 2006). Georgian has two morphological devices in this domain: stem-suppletion and the preverb da- (Makharoblidze 2018). I argue for three separate but interrelated claims: (i) Georgian exhibits genuine, structurally constrained root suppletion, supporting a late insertion view contra Borer (2014); (ii) Bobaljik & Harley (2017)'s generalization that all intransitive verbs which supplete for number are unaccusatives can be upheld; (iii) a unified analysis for root suppletion and the preverb da- is possible.",0
"This paper investigates the spread of the le/la/les-forms in the diachrony of French on large-scale corpus data. In particular, it focuses on the issue of their ""mixed"" distribution viz. the observation that during a long period of time the le/la/les-forms in French do not pattern as either (anaphoric) demonstratives from which they originate (Late Latin ille), nor as (uniqueness-based) definites, which they end up becoming in Modern French. We model the phenomenon as a competition between two grammars which ascribe different Logical Forms to the l-forms and test model predictions in contexts which differ with respect to whether they satisfy the relevant conditions. We also propose that this change was part of a larger change involving the spread of presupposition triggers within noun phrases. We show that our model correctly predicts the relative rates of determiner spread in various contexts.",0
"This work treats of the morphophonology of verbal stress in A'ingae (Cofán, ISO 639-3: con), an isolate language of the Amazon. By presenting and generalizing over novel data, it makes contributions to language description, typology, and theory.

At the level of description, it demonstrates the sensitivity of stress to weight in A'ingae, systematizes the template of verbal inflections, and details its intricate patterns of morphophonological alternations.

At the level of typology, it observes a rare, if not unattested, accentual pattern, whereby the primary stress targets the syllable containing the second mora to the left of a glottal stop.

At the level of theory, it provides an account within the framework of Cophonology Theory (Anttila, 1997; Orgun, 1996; others) and lends support to the framework by the dint of its analytical parsimony.",1
"Tlingit verbs appear to be single phonological words but they are constructed from a large number of distinct morphological elements that correspond to argument structure, event structure, aspect, mood, modality, tense, and qualia. Previous analyses have accounted for the verbal morphology of Tlingit with opaque position class template systems. These systems present the internal structure of verbs as arbitrary and do not address the many dependencies between elements. This dissertation argues that the Tlingit verb implements a regular syntax with each morpheme instantiating a syntactic terminal. Ordering within the verb word is a consequence of regular syntactic structure with all dependencies between elements reflecting selection and agreement phenomena. The verb-internal syntax requires no extraordinary theoretical mechanisms: Tlingit verb morphology is neither unique nor problematic from a theoretical perspective.

To demonstrate this argument, this dissertation develops a formal theoretical model of Tlingit verbal structure within the Minimalist Program framework. An acategorial root forms the basis of the syntactic structure, encoding the majority of lexical properties. Other verbal morphology is either functional heads such as v, Voice, and Asp, or minimal lexical elements such as D pronouns or N incorporates. As well as phonological form and encyclopedic meaning, roots also encode valency, qualia, durativity, stativity, and irrealis, along with other morphosyntactic properties. These properties influence both the syntactic functions and semantic interpretations of the functional heads, so that the syntax and semantics of each head is contextually dependent, fully predictable and compositional. Long distance dependencies arise from selection, movement, and agreement between heads. Every morpheme either saturates or restricts an event or an argument, thus predictably contributing to the structure and interpretation of the whole verb. Movement and spellout are determined by phases which correspond to regular domains in the phonological verb word and phrase. Careful attention is paid to many supposedly irregular or lexical phenomena, showing that most are extensions of regular phenomena, and that some actually reflect underdocumented grammatical patterns. The results of this research have many implications for linguistic theory and for related Na-Dene languages and provide a robust analytical foundation for Tlingit language teaching and revitalization.",1
"Studying affix order concerns understanding the principles behind affix placement. In this paper, we document our fieldwork results on mobile affixes in Armenian. We focus on four Armenian lects: Standard Western, Hamshen, Gyumri, and Akhalkalaki. We focus on the imperfect indicative which is shared across the four lects but has a divergent distribution across them. Diachronically, the INDC affix was a prefix in Middle Armenian, and in most modern Western Armenian lects like Standard Western. But in some dialects, the affix is mobile and its placement is determined by phonological, syntactic, and prosodic factors. In Hamshen, the only factor is phonological. The morpheme is a prefix in V-initial words and a suffix elsewhere. In Gyumri and Akhalkalkali, there are additional syntactic factors involved. In general, C-initial verbs take the suffix but can exceptionally take the prefix under specific syntactic conditions. In Akhalkalaki, affix order is additionally influenced from sentential prosody. The morpheme can leave the verb and cliticize onto the stressed constituent.",1

"Abstract
This paper provides an overview of lexical and clausal nominalization in Esahie, a relatively underdescribed and undocumented Kwa language. We show that in Esahie, lexical nominalizations lose
all verbal properties whilst clausal nominalizations retain certain verbal features. Overall,
nominalization in Esahie is typically a case of lexical rather than clausal nominalization. Lexical
nominalizations in Esahie may take the form of simple affixation, parasynthesis or compounding.
We also provide further empirical support against Aronoff's (1976) Unitary Base Hypothesis and
show that certain inflectional operators in Esahie belong to the group of word-class-changing
inflectional markers (cf. Haspelmath 1996; Bauer 2004). Data used in this work emanates from a
series of fieldworks conducted in the Western-North region of Ghana, and the argumentation
approach adopted is descriptive.",0
"Free word order in Slav(on)ic languages, intensively investigated for about a century, has been a rich source of inspiration for linguistic theory. The present paper provides a balanced survey of the study of free word order in Slavonic languages - from the pioneering Prague School research to current quantitative (experimental or corpus) research. We start with a brief historical survey of approaches to the study of word order and information structure, with particular focus on the Prague School and its international impact. Next, we summarize the various grammatical, prosodic, and pragmatic factors that can motivate word order alternations, mentioning the role of theta roles, syntactic function, morphological case, topicality, givenness, focus, contrast, prosody, referentiality, animacy, humanness, quantifier scope, and pronominal binding. We then move on to current generative approaches to word order, centering around the A vs. A'-scrambling/movement distinction, and provide an overview of a range of theories. We close the paper by discussing recent corpus and experimental findings and point out their relevance to theory.",0

"The centrality of feature in syntax upholds the view that features or feature bundles drive the syntactic computations (Chomsky 1995); suggests that the syntactic projections are drawn identifying each head with a single feature (Kayne 1994), and eventually attaining the size of a morpheme, a word and a phrase (Starke 2009). Such feature based account introduces a sense that syntax is ""language-free"" (see Starke 2009 for details); cross-linguistic similarities and differences are rather due to the feature/s, and all linguistic phenomena and structures can be analysed syntactically which can be summarised as 'there are features, and none other enters into computation.'
	This tenet seems to be promising in cross-linguistic, cross-modality studies specially in the study of various aspects of structure in sign language which have no parallel in spoken language which are generally dubbed as sign language universals. One such phenomenon is a type of pointing gesture in sign language that the signer uses to point to someone or something either manually and/or non-manually with the eye gaze or the body orientation. It is often labelled as INDEX, and is used to refer to an object, referents, spatial location, or events around the signer and the addressee in a common observable space. In sign language literature, such phenomena are generally ascribed to the modality differences that the sign language employ. Such ascriptions, however, paradoxically fail to provide account of phenomena arising from the same C-I system as the difference between sign and spoken language is the difference of the S-M system that impose different optimal conditions for convergence rather than the difference of the C-I system. 
	This paper aims to address that the 'modality differences' do not make sign language unique by virtue of its S-M system, rather the interface requirements of the S-M system creates the differences in terms of the feature, and INDEX refers to such feature(s). It aims to provide an account of the structure building feature(s) associated with various instances of INDEX in Indian Sign Language based on feature inventory sugggested by Wiltschko (2009), Nevins (2007), Harbour (2006), Déchaine and Wiltschko (2002, 2007), Ghomeshi, Paul and Wiltschko (2009), etc. among others. 
	This paper is divided into four broad sections. In section 2, the facts relating to INDEX in Indian Sign Language are described specifically showing the multiple syntactic functions of INDEX in the grammar of Indian Sign Language. A summary of the previous analyses of INDEX in sign language literature is provided to highlight the inadequacies in the explanation of the phenomenon under discussion in section 3. In the following concluding section, based on feature inventory, the papers draws a feature inventory of INDEX in Indian Sign Language, and shows that it is associated with multiple features in congruity; and each instance of INDEX refers to the feature(s).",1
"In this paper, I discuss differences between representational change (i.e. in formal features and structures involved in grammatical competence) and change in quantitative patterns (i. e. in the quantitative properties of the language system in use), as relevant to my approach to incrementation. My approach differs from the standard variationist sociolinguistic approach because I argue that representational input-divergence along the child learning path contributes to quantitative differences between children and older speakers, most importantly the input speakers. In this way, the Inverted U Model (IUM) for incrementation offers an initial sketch of a linking theory between (a) child developmental findings for competence-related changes over acquisitional time in the individual, and (b) the change-in-progress phenomenon of incrementation which describes how usage rates for innovative variants advance relative to
conservative variants in speakers in the community over generational time.",0
"The present paper proposes an articulatory and acoustic study of the representation of Yorùbá tones in gángan (a talking drum). The video and spectrographic analyses of the data collected from five native drummers in Nigeria show the number of syllables in a word directly corresponds to the number of strikes on the drum membrane. As the talking drum resonates from the strikes, the drummers tightened and loosened the drum membrane to articulate the three tones in Yorùbá. Furthermore, tonal processes such as tone contour formation on the second tone in HL or LH sequences are musically rendered. Based on this evidence, this paper concludes that drummers are able to represent syllables, lexical tones and tonal processes of Yorùbá speech with a talking drum.",0
"Beyond the two usual types of numerals (i.e. cardinal and ordinal numerals) are other types
like fractional, frequentative, distributive and multiplicative numerals which present very interesting linguistic properties. However, research on numerals usually focus on either cardinal
or ordinal numerals. This paper provides a detailed description of the structure and formation
of non-cardinal and non-ordinal numerals in Akan as well as a constructionist account of their
properties. In the description of the facts, we show that the formal structure of the various
classes of numerals is quite regular because they inherit their structure from already existing
syntactic and morphological constructions in the language, including coordinate constructions,
compounds and reduplicated forms. In the proposed theoretical account, we show that Construction Morphology provides the appropriate tools for the analysis of the numerals because
the framework anticipates form-meaning disparities, thus making it possible to account for
both compositional and extra-compositional properties of the numerals. The properties of the
various types of numerals are captured in schemas which abstract over their general and idiosyncratic properties. We posit constructional idioms in which specific aspects of the numerals,
regarded as constructional properties, are prespecified in the schemas and inherited by instantiating constructions.",0
"Yiddish was the everyday language spoken by most Central and East European Jews during the last millennium. As a result of the extreme loss of speakers during the Holocaust, subsequent geographic dispersal, and lack of institutional support, Yiddish is now an endangered language. Yet it continues to be a native and daily language for Haredi (strictly Orthodox) Jews, who live in close-knit communities worldwide. We have conducted the first study of the linguistic characteristics of the Yiddish spoken in the community in London's Stamford Hill. While Krogh (2012), Assouline (2014), and Sadock & Masor (2018), investigating other Hasidic Yiddish-speaking communities, observe what they describe as morphological syncretism, in this paper we defend the claim that present-day Stamford Hill Hasidic Yiddish lacks morphological case and gender completely. We demonstrate that loss of morphological case and gender is the result of substantial language change over the course of two generations: while the case and gender system of the spoken medium was already beginning to undergo morphological syncretism and show some variation prior to World War II, case and gender distinctions were clearly present in the mental grammar of both Hasidic and non-Hasidic speakers of the relevant Yiddish dialects at that stage. We conclude the paper by identifying some of the language-internal, sociolinguistic and historical factors that have contributed to such rapid and pervasive language change, and compare the developments in Stamford Hill Hasidic Yiddish to those of minority German dialects in North America.",1

"Case competition is a phenomenon which may arise when a noun is assigned two cases. Grammars tend to resolve the situation by eliminating one of the two cases, and this is what I look at in this book. Specifically, I investigate the rules and constraints that accompany this process, and argue that such facts can be understood if case competition is nothing but ellipsis of a case-marker under c-command and identity with (a subpart of) the remaining case marker.

 As a consequence, the notion of case competition is eliminated from the grammar at the level of underlying mechanisms, and its effects are subsumed under the theory of ellipsis.

"The study of language contact is of crucial importance to our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of language. A fundamental process and result of contact-induced language change is borrowing. This has rightly been considered one of the principal sources of language change, along with sound change and analogy and consequently it plays a decisive role in the field of contact linguistics. The Romance languages have the potential to contribute substantially to this area of investigation, since they have a wide geospatial distribution, a long history of contact with several typologically diverse languages, and are abundantly documented. However, this great potential has remained largely unexploited in one main respect: the Romance data have not been used in their entirety to test theories of contact-induced language change and in particular borrowing. The present chapter takes up this challenge and, by drawing on empirical evidence from a broad range of Romance varieties, aims to outline contact-induced grammatical change and provide a critical assessment of the state-of-the-art in research on borrowing as a key mechanism of contact-induced language change and variation.",0

This paper seeks to account for the historical-comparative distribution of ad as a DOM-marker in Romance by resorting to well-established DOM-parameters in the nominal and verbal domains (Serzant and Witzlack-Makarevich (2018)) as represented in cartographic models of Minimalist syntax (Cinque (1999, 2002)). Based on these premises, three macrotypes of Romance DOM are established and their common historical roots in Latin/proto-Romance are investigated.",0
"Half a century ago, Uriel Weinreich, William Labov, and Marvin Herzog laid out a programmatic vision for the study of language change. This included establishing five fundamental problems for the field and a radical shift from a focus on idiolects to a focus on population-level change (grounded in their concept of orderly heterogeneity). They also expressed an explicit desire to see an integrated evolutionary study of language change. In spite of this, the newer fields of language evolution and cultural evolution make little contact with the field of sociolinguistics that emerged out of their work. Here we lay out a program, grounded in their five problems, for a more integrated future. We situate each problem in modern sociolinguistics and identify promising points for theoretical exchange, making comparisons with Tinbergen's four questions, which play a similar role in the evolutionary sciences. Finally, we propose cultural-evolutionary experiments for making empirical progress.",0
"In Buriat, the consonant realized contextually as dorsal or uvular alternates with zero at stem-suffix boundaries (Poppe, 1938, 1960; Sanžeev, 1941; Sanžeev et al., 1962; Čeremisov, 1973). This alternation has been known as a case epenthesis that challenges the existing theories of phonological markedness (Rice, 2008; Morley, 2015; Vaux & Samuels, 2015). The analysis of this alternation has also been debated (de Lacy, 2006; de Lacy & Kingston, 2013). This paper presents new fieldwork and experimental evidence showing that the reported epenthesis pattern fails to be generalized to new environments. The results go against the phonological insertion account of the alternation, and instead support the analysis of Buriat dorsal-zero alternation in terms of floating features, present only on the relevant native affixes. These results thus suggest that Buriat is not a counterexample to dorsal markedness. The fact that dorsal epenthesis is not generalized despite relatively robust native evidence is also consistent with a learning bias against unnatural alternations (White, 2014; Hayes & White, 2015).",1
"We ilustrate the complexity and interest of English phonology and morphology through two case studies: the phonological and morphological behavior of sibilant suffixes, and the aspiration of voiceless obstruents. We focus on documenting individual variation in these areas and examining theoretical proposals that have been advanced to account for the attested range of variation that is found, highlighting cases where the data connect to larger issues in phonological and morphological theory.",0
"This paper presents an analysis of person-conditioned word order alternations in two Tsimshianic languages: Nisg̲a'a (Interior) and \Smalgyax/Coast Tsimshian (Maritime).  In both branches of the family, inverse configurations where third persons act on participants require VOS word order, in marked deviation from base VSO.  I argue that VOS order in the inverse configurations is inadequately addressed by an object-raising analysis.  I instead present an account of V1 order across Tsimshianic as broadly derived via predicate raising.  Furthermore, I propose that the special order of inverse configurations is in both branches motivated by person licensing, but by a different licensing condition in each branch.

For Interior Tsimshianic, a morphological licensing condition broadly mandates that participant pronouns surface as verb-adjacent.  I demonstrate how the linearization algorithm can accommodate this requirement, and how this condition predicts two additional adjacency effects.  For Maritime Tsimshianic, a syntactic licensing condition drives a complex differential-subject-marking agreement pattern.  I demonstrate how an analysis of VOS similar to an object incorporation construction can be arrived at by invoking feature conflict between the inverse subject and object, followed by detransitivization.  As in other languages, the inverse configuration of arguments is treated as something of a non-canonical voice construction.",0
"Pronominal paradigms in Philippine-type Austronesian languages show a robust and curious gap: in transitive clauses pivot arguments and non-pivot agents may have bound pronominal forms, appearing as second position clitics, but pronominal non-pivot themes must be full, free pronouns. This gap teaches us about the organization of the lower phase edge. As cliticization involves a syntactic dependency between the host and argument position and all syntactic dependencies are constrained by phases, the gap is explained if pivots and non-pivot agents are specifiers of the phase head, making them the only DPs accessible for operations from outside of the lower phase.",0
"Children acquiring Spanish interpret subject pronouns differently from adults, initially relying on pragmatic cues instead of morphosyntactic cues that are more statistically reliable. Following Gagliardi et al. (2017), we use Bayesian cognitive modeling to explore the sources of this non-adult-like behavior, investigating whether it is more likely due to (i) noise in children's representation of the probability that some cues favor certain antecedents, or (ii) noise in children's deployment of otherwise adult-like probabilities. Results favor noisy deployment as the source of children's non-adult-like pronoun resolution.",0

"This paper discusses predicational structures in some Aromanian varieties which involve PP or AP predicates combining with the copula BE. In these structures the internal argument and subject of BE is cross-referenced by an accusative clitic, as long as it is 3rd person and a topic. However, Individual-Level APs typically resist cliticisation. We propose that the clitic is the spell-out of topic and gender umber features available in Stage-Level predicates only (a spatio- temporal argument à la Kratzer 1995), with which the subject agrees, before agreeing with T. We argue that this structural property captures the restriction to Stage-Level predicate subject topics, the person restriction, and also the fact that the clitic behaves like a direct object clitic morphosyntactically.

"In a theory of attraction, an element (the goal) moves to satisfy the needs of a functional head (the probe) (Chomsky 2000, 2001). Wh-movement is a canonical example of such movement: to form a constituent question, the specifier of C must contain a wh-phrase. In this paper, we explore whether pronoun movement, a type of movement that does not fit so neatly into a theory of attraction, can be brought closer together to wh-movement. In particular, we investigate whether it is possible to see effects of the Principle of Minimal Compliance (PMC) - an economy constraint that Richards (1998) proposes is active in multiple wh-movement - in the domain of Sierra Zapotec multiple pronoun movement. We identify two constraints on pronoun movement that are lifted once they have been minimally complied with. First, basic locality, and second, certain hierarchy-sensitive restrictions on the movement of pronouns, which we call Gender–Case Constraints  (GCCs; Toosarvandani 2017, Foley, Kalivoda, and Toosarvandani 2019, to appear), by analogy to the more familiar Person–Case Constraint (PCC; Perlmutter 1971, Bonet 1991).",1

"This paper identifies and tests a novel diagnostic for clause structure in West Circassian, a polysynthetic language with ergative alignment. The diagnostic concerns an unusual construction involving multiple wh-agreement in relative clauses. I argue that wh-agreement morphology uniformly tracks agreement with a wh-trace, and sentences with more than one instance of wh-agreement are surface manifestations of a parasitic gap dependency. Once multiple wh-agreement is understood in this theoretically familiar light, it can be used as a powerful tool for diagnosing asymmetries between various constituents in the West Circassian clause. By appealing to well-known constraints on parasitic gap licensing, the paper demonstrates that the absolutive DP raises to a position c-commanding other clausemate DPs, and applied objects may undergo optional scrambling to a position above the ergative agent.",0
"Ideophones, also termed ""mimetics"" or ""expressives,"" are marked words that depict sensory imagery. They are found in many of the world's languages, and sizable lexical classes of ideophones are particularly well-documented in languages of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Ideophones are not limited to onomatopoeia like meow and smack, but cover a wide range of sensory domains, such as manner of motion (e.g., plisti plasta 'splish-splash' in Basque), texture (e.g., tsaklii 'rough' in Ewe), and psychological states (e.g., wakuwaku 'excited' in Japanese). Across languages, ideophones stand out as marked words due to special phonotactics, expressive morphology including certain types of reduplication, and relative syntactic independence, in addition to production features like prosodic foregrounding and common co-occurrence with iconic gestures.

Three intertwined issues have been repeatedly debated in the century-long literature on ideophones. 1) Definition: Isolated descriptive traditions and cross-linguistic variation have sometimes obscured a typologically unified view of ideophones, but recent advances show the promise of a prototype definition of ideophones as conventionalised depictions in speech, with room for language-specific nuances. 2) Integration: The variable integration of ideophones across linguistic levels reveals an interaction between expressiveness and grammatical integration, and has important implications for how to conceive of dependencies between linguistic systems. 3) Iconicity: Ideophones form a natural laboratory for the study of iconic form-meaning associations in natural languages, and converging evidence from corpus and experimental studies suggests important developmental, evolutionary, and communicative advantages of ideophones.",0
"This paper examines the existence and classification of zero exponence in Distributed Morphology (DM), and which types of zero exponence are essential for this theory. In this paper, propose the following: 1) Zero exponence in DM can be divided into three types: Preferential, Elsewhere, and Dependent; 2) DM cannot exclude Preferential zero exponence because of its competition and underspecification system for determining exponence; 3) DM does not need to assume Elsewhere zero exponence in No Insertion analysis; and 4) Dependent zero exponence can be analyzed by Obliteration. Furthermore, I explore the existence of zero exponence in an empirical ground through the analysis of the sentence-medial particle in Japanese.",0

"Human language is exclusive among all primary vocal communicating tools used in the kingdom animalia. However, there are debates on what makes human language exclusive. Among these debates, the most persuasive view is that human language is unique by the virtue of infinite syntactic recursion, which is universal to all human languages. The latest development of this view is backed by certain biological investigation and duly criticized by other scholars. In this paper, I argue that language is not a single product of a solitary process of evolution of the so-called linguistic species Homo sapiens. Thus, syntactic recursion may not be the universal aspect of all human languages. Syntactic recursion can be imagined only as an essential property of some developed languages that may not always be empirically observable. To consider human language as exclusive, I argue that human language in-itself is such a field where context-specific choice-based linguistic expressions are made up of certain syntagmatic relationships. These are substituted paradigmatically, instead of imagining language as a result of syntactic recursiveness, the fundamental function of universal grammar.",0
"We conduct a manual error analysis of the CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 Shared Task on Morphological Reinflection. In this task, systems are given a word in citation form (e.g., hug) and asked to produce the corresponding inflected form (e.g., the simple past hugged). This design lets us analyze errors much like we might analyze children's production errors. We propose an error taxonomy and use it to annotate errors made by the top two systems across twelve languages. Many of the observed errors are related to inflectional patterns sensitive to inherent linguistic properties such as animacy or affect; many others are failures to predict truly unpredictable inflectional behaviors. We also find nearly one quarter of the residual ""errors"" reflect errors in the gold data.",1
"This paper focuses on a pattern of systematic syncretism in Spanish
se constructions. Detailed morpho-syntactic and semantic analyses are provided with the aim of sustaining three main theses. First, the common property behind this pattern is a syntactically unsatisfied subcategorization feature present in the Voice head, which is satisfied at PF through the introduction of the clitic se. Second, theta-roles are syntactic primitives that can be assigned in a long-distance fashion up to argument activity (aka syntactic visibility) plus some locality conditions. Third, at LF, theta-roles are semantically realized as functions from entities to event predicates (i.e., < e,< s, t >>) on K(ase) heads. This last thesis conceives of structural K as an argument introducer mediating between predicates (pure event properties) and arguments, whose particular semantics is syntactically determined; i.e., via allosemy.

[NB: My last stance on SE-syncretism can be found in lingbuzz (under the title ""Deconstructing Voice""). I gave up with part of the story told in this version (in particular with the radical view of SE as a PF expletive), but I will leave here as I think that someone can disagree with my last stance.]",0
"This paper investigates agreement on past participles in Highest Alemannic dialects of  German. We  will  first  show  that  participle  agreement  only  occurs  in  contexts  where  the  participle  is  adjectival, viz., in stative passives and in resultative perfects, but not in eventive perfects. The 
 participles  thus  pattern  with  predicative  adjectives,  which  also  display  agreement  in  these  varieties. In the main part of the paper, we address double compound perfects and eventive passives, which also display agreement on the lexical participle. Even though it is initially not 
obvious that the  participle is adjectival in these cases, we will provide syntactic evidence for their adjectival  status. Furthermore, we will pursue the hypothesis that the adjectival head of all agreeing participles is a stativizer, even in the double compound perfect and the eventive passive. At the same time, both the double compound perfect and the eventive passive also clearly have an eventive component. We will model their behavior by treating the participles as mixed categories, viz., as adjectival heads that take a large amount of verbal structure as their complement (VoiceP/AspP). While recent work on German stative passives has argued that even those should be analyzed as containing a substantial amount of verbal structure, the behavior 
of participles in the double perfect and the eventive passive in the varieties under consideration is clearly different. They thus contribute to the typology of adjectival passives in German and beyond and show that the familiar distinction between 'adjectival' and 'verbal' participles needs 
to be further refined.",0
"We examine patterns of syncretism in suppletive verbal stems in the Papuan language Yelmek. Yelmek verbs can supplete based on both the number and gender features of their objects; we discuss these in light of a prediction of gender umber syncretisms made in Kramer (2018), namely that if plural agreement morphology is syncretic with a particular singular gender, then it will be the default gender. Yelmek suppletion displays all syncretism patterns except this pattern; however we argue that this does not constitute a real counter-example to Kramer's prediction, as the syncretic gender appears to be unspecified, if not default.",0
"Baker (2015) suggests that the dependent theory of case (Marantz 1991, a.o.) is a formulation of the intuition that morphological case functions to differentiate nominals. This paper presents novel evidence for this idea from the agreement system of Yimas. Departing from previous characterizations of the language, this paper argues that the Yimas agreement morphemes are actually doubled pronominal clitics, and that they exhibit paradigmatic alternations that parallel the distributions of dependent case on nominals crosslinguistically. Crucially, clitic doubling in Yimas is optional; once this is taken into account, it is revealed that the morphological form of a given clitic covaries with the total number of clitics present, even when the sentence-level syntax is held constant: how a clitic is realized is thus dependent on its clitic environment. This context-dependence is analyzed as a dissimilation process, which applies to distinguish between multiple morphosyntactically indistinguishable clitics; this arises whenever multiple DPs are doubled. Thus, both clitic dissimilation in Yimas and dependent case on nominals can be viewed as alternations that are controlled by morphosyntactic context, albeit in different structural domains.",0
"This paper provides an overview of the Prosodic Transfer Hypothesis (PTH), which accounts for certain difficulties that learners experience with L2 morphosyntax. We focus on inflection and articles, which have often been accounted for through defective syntactic representations or problems with the interface between morphology and syntax (inflection) and between semantics or discourse/pragmatics and syntax (articles). We argue that some problems in these domains reflect transfer of L1 prosodic constraints: certain forms cannot be prosodically represented as target-like and hence are omitted or mispronounced. We trace how the PTH has developed over time, from its initial instantiation as involving permanent L1 transfer, to currently, where L1 representations are seen as adaptable to the needs of the L2, and new representations can in fact be acquired. We provide an overview of work conducted in this framework and discuss how the
theory has been extended beyond production to encompass comprehension and processing.",0
"This paper is concerned with restrictions on Left-Branch Extraction (LBE) in
Bulgarian and Macedonian, the only two Slavic languages with articles. The
data indicate that the availability of LBE is related to the number of modifers, and thus require a revision of the generalisation that all languages with articles disallow LBE. Following Martinović (2019), Calabrese & Pescarini (2014), a solution based on the order of operations is proposed, connecting the availability of LBE to the idea that projections can be removed via syntactic operations such as Exfoliation (Pesetsky 2019). The application of Exfoliation depends on the relative timing of article placement, which in turn is performed via a (revised) post-syntactic operation of Generalised Lowering (Embick & Noyer 2001). Exfoliation and subsequently LBE are fed by an early application of Lowering, assumed to be able to interleave narrow syntax (Martinović 2019), but if applied late, Lowering counter-feeds these two operations.",0
"Picture-selection studies testing the comprehension of subject-verb agreement across a wide variety of languages have found that children fail to use these markers to infer the cardinality of a null or masked subject, even long after spontaneous production of agreement becomes adult-like (Johnson et al. 2005, Pérez-Leroux 2005, Gxilishe et al. 2009, Rastegar et al., 2010). This production/comprehension asymmetry has since been called into question by researchers using more sensitive comprehension measures (Brandt-Kobele and Höhle 2010, Legendre et al. 2014, Verhagen & Blom 2014, González-Gómez et al. 2017). Here, we continue to use a picture selection task but expand our focus to include 1st and 2nd person markers, which are more phonologically salient and less complex to interpret than 3rd person markers. We find that preschoolers comprehend Spanish 1st and 2nd person agreement markers early (2;3-2;11) and just as accurately as clitic pronouns, showing that comprehension of agreement is not uniformly difficult. In the 3rd person, accuracy was low not only for agreement but also for clitics, and both adults and children allowed these expressions to refer to a prominent referent from the immediately preceding discourse-even if that referent was the speaker or hearer. We argue that the production/comprehension asymmetry originally observed for 3rd person agreement was driven not just by task demands but also by children's sensitivity to the discourse dependence of 3rd person referring expressions. Future experimental investigations of agreement markers should take their discourse properties into account.",0
"German free relative constructions allow for case requirement mismatches under two types of circumstances. The first is when the case required in the embedded clause is more complex (NOM < ACC < GEN < DAT) than the case required in the main clause, and the relative pronoun takes the form of the embedded clause case. The second type of circumstance is when the form that corresponds to the two required cases is syncretic. I propose an analysis that combines Caha's (2009) case hierarchy in Nanosyntax with Van Riemsdijk's (2006a) concept of Grafting. By placing case features as separate heads in the syntax, a less complex case can be Grafted into a different clause, explaining the first type of circumstance. The second type makes reference to the fact that syncretic forms are inserted via the same lexical entry (Superset Principle). A cross-linguistic comparison shows that it is language-specific whether a more complex case requirement in the main or embedded clause causes non-matching non-syncretic free relatives to be grammatical. For all languages it holds that the relative pronoun appears in the most complex case required, which provides additional evidence for case being complex and more complex cases being able to license less complex cases.",0
"We present a case study in the marking of the negative prefix in French gradable adjectives, where the productive marker iN- alternates with a number of unproductive prefixes, like dé(s)-, dis-, mal-, mé(s)-. We treat this as a classical case of allomorphy, and present an account of the distribution of these allomorphs in terms of the nanosyntactic mechanism of pointers, by which lexical items may point to other, existing, lexical items in the postsyntactic lexicon. We claim that  unproductive lexical items are not directly accessible for the spellout mechanism, but only indirectly, via pointers. We show how the analysis accounts for lexicalised semantics in derivations, as well as cases where the formal relationship between derivational pairs is not concatenative, but substitutive.",0
"I argue verb doubling in verb-fronting predicate clefts provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that head-to-head movement (or, more neutrally, head displacement) is the result of a different operation from the one responsible for phrasal movement. Though some authors argue head displacement is a PF-branch phenomenon, I argue this operation occurs before Spell-Out, at least if phrasal-movement is modeled under the Copy Theory of Movement. The primary evidence comes from the observation that predicate clefts require head displacement to derivationally feed overt A'-movement. Since overt A'-movement occurs before Spell-Out, head displacement also must. This challenges post-syntactic approaches to head displacement phenomena, but only if narrow-syntactic movement is modeled under the Copy Theory of Movement; multidominance requires post-syntactic head displacement.",0
"This paper begins as a reply to Taraldsen et al (2018), wherein it is argued that shared gender features do not underlie singular/plural noun class pairs in Xhosa. Taraldsen et al's claim is based on the fact that when singulars of a given noun class are conjoined, there is typically default subject agreement with the conjunct rather than agreement in the relevant plural class. My paper shows that similar phenomena are found in Slavic languages which have more canonical gender systems (masculine, feminine, neuter), and that an existing analysis (Boskovič 2009) easily explains the Xhosa facts that Taraldsen et al report. My paper then explores conjoined plurals, showing how a pattern of LCA (last conjunct agreement) with preverbal subjects reported in Mitchley (2015) parallels Serbo-Croatian and is also amenable to an analysis in Boskovič (2009). However, I also show that supplementary research of my own reveals a complex pattern of preferences determining agreement with conjoined plurals, in the speakers in my study, which would not be expected under Boskovič's approach, or under recent approaches of Marušič et al (2015), Nevins & Marušič (to appear), and Murphy & Puškar (2017). I argue for a novel analysis under which multiple gender values are copied from all conjuncts to T's uPhi, if &P is raising to preverbal position, and then those values are reduced to one by impoverishment, informed by interacting hierarchies of preference favoring (i) FCA > LCA > default, and (ii) agreement with least marked > most marked noun classes.",0
"Child language acquisition is often identified as one of the primary drivers of language change, but the lack of historical child data presents a challenge for empirically investigating its effect. In this work, I observe the relationship between lexicons extracted from modern child-directed speech and those drawn from modern and historical literary corpora in order to better understand when language acquisition can be modeled over historical and non-child corpora as it is over child corpora. The type frequencies of morphophonological and syntactic-semantic patterns occur at similar type frequencies in these corpora among high token frequency items, and furthermore, when a learning algorithm is applied to lexicons sampled from these sources, it consistently achieves the same learning outcomes in each. With appropriate care and pre-processing, modern and historical text corpora are effectively interchangeable with child-directed speech corpora for the purpose of estimating child lexical experience, opening a path for modeling language acquisition where child-directed corpora are not available.",0
"Much work in Distributed Morphology (Embick 2010, 2015; Bobaljik 2012; Harley, Tubino, and Haugen 2017; Bobaljik and Harley, to appear) holds that morphosyntactically conditioned contextual allomorphy, including suppletion, can only work in a very local fashion: two morphemes must be linearly or structurally adjacent for one to determine the morphological exponence of the other. Recently, however, the existence of nonlocal patterns has come into focus, with growing evidence that nonlocal allomorphy is an attested empirical option. In this squib, I discuss the allomorphy of verb stems in the Nakh-Daghestanian language Aqusha Dargwa and argue that the choice between allomorphs in morphological causatives in that language is determined nonlocally by tense–aspect–mood (TAM), proposing that Vocabulary Insertion can be exempt from locality requirements under certain conditions.",0
"Given the central spot afforded to unvalued features in current theorizing, the directionality of feature valuation is the subject of a lively debate in the syntactic literature. The present squib discusses, using data from Avar, a crosslinguistically rare phenomenon of adposition agreement, whereby certain adverbs, postpositions and locative case forms undergo agreement with an absolutive argument. I show that the agreement patterns in Avar are best derived on the traditional, ""upward"", view of feature valuation (Chomsky 2000).",0
"This chapter addresses aspects of the morphosyntax of the definite and the indefinite articles. The organizational principle of the chapter resides in contrasting the two, emphasizing that they are NOT variants of a single category, but that they are completely distinct categories in pretty much every regard. 
The chapter mentions similarities and connections between the articles and other grammatical categories of natural language such as numerals, demonstratives, gender and noun class markers, and classifiers, etc. It is intended to draw attention to data structural patterns that may be relevant to a better understanding of the morphosyntactic nature articles.",1
"We claim that Japanese honorification involves no dedicated grammatical apparatus, contra longstanding analytical tradition. Examining the components of two productive honorification strategies, we show that these components lack honorific meaning in isolation, but are nominal in nature. We therefore suggest that Japanese honorifics are built from general nominalisation processes and light verb constructions. We also recharacterize 'honorific suppletives' as semantically bleached verbal substitutions, showing that their distribution conforms to a general morphophonological constraint of Japanese, which we call the monomoraic constraint. Crucially, this honorification-as-nominalization approach eschews ad hoc, honorification-specific grammatical machinery, advocating for a minimal and economical featural inventory.",1
"In Cheshire's (1982) seminal study of Reading adolescents, it is no surprise to find robust use of negative concord, the most ubiquitous 'vernacular universal' of varieties of English worldwide. In this paper we analyse one aspect of the grammar of negative concord in a variety spoken in Scotland: the variability in the expression of a sentential negation marker in the presence of a negative noun phrase. We develop a syntactic analysis that accounts for the quantitative patterns in our corpus, which further extends to concrete, and correct, predictions about unobserved forms. Our analysis also has implications for understanding both why negative concord is a vernacular universal, and for accounting for differences in individual speakers' grammars and their use.

"This thesis advances a theoretical move toward a grammatical model devoid of interface conditions by proposing a novel feature-based structure-building mechanism. In the standardly assumed architecture of grammar, ungrammaticality is often explained in terms of a violation of some condition on an output of the syntactic module. However, some recent research in linguistics has attempted to move away from such an approach to ungrammaticality and proposed to reinterpret ungrammaticality as non-generability. In this approach, ill-formed structures are construed not as defective but as impossible to generate with the available syntactic operations. In order to advocate for the latter approach to ungrammaticality, this thesis examines an interface condition called the Person Licensing Condition (PLC), which was proposed to account
for a linguistic phenomenon known as the Person Case Constraint (PCC). It is shown in the thesis that the PLC fails to capture cross-linguistic variation in the PCC patterns and in the way illicit structures are remedied. It is further argued that previous, Agree-based accounts of the PCC variation, also reliant on an interface condition, cannot fully explain all the patterns and that they obscure the source of the variation.
This thesis proposes an alternative account of the PCC, which involves a version of Merge that is constrained by feature valuation, and what is known as articulated person features. The proposed syntactic system allows arguments to engage with each other by valuing the same unvalued feature, and this explains person restriction effects seen in the PCC patterns. Illicit argument combinations are underivable in the system, and an interface condition is not needed to account for ungrammaticality induced by the PCC. This novel account of the PCC also captures the variation fairly well, and because the variation is attributed to different ways
syntactic elements are featurally specified in different languages, the reason why we obtain such variation is clear. In defending the person features used in the proposed syntactic mechanism, this thesis also speaks to the typology of grammatical persons and shows that the same features explain not only syntactic restrictions like the PCC but also a variety of morphological neutralization phenomena.",0
"Compounds and phrases have been extensively contrasted on formal and
functional grounds in the literature. Much less is known, however, about the
cognitive differences between the two. The present article uses this
observation as a point of departure and investigates whether non-lexicalized
German adjective-noun compounds and phrases differ in how well they are
memorized. Crucially, the contribution goes beyond previous research on this
issue by (a) concentrating on the auditory presentation of compounds and
phrases within a single language that uses both types as a naming device, (b)
considering the role of prosodic prominence in the compound-phrase divide in
German, and (c) looking at non-lexicalized constructions either without or with
an explicitly given invented meaning. Two experiments are reported, in which
subjects were asked to memorize auditorily presented compounds and
phrases and participated in a response-time and response-accuracy
experiment. While the constructions were not associated with a specific and
explicitly given meaning in Experiment 1, they were in Experiment 2. The data
show that compounds are memorized more efficiently than phrases, both
without and with an explicitly given meaning, and independently from their
prosodic prominence pattern. It is argued that the effect derives from their
formal and functional characteristics.",0
"This topic of this paper is kinds of second position (2P) clitics in Caquinte (Kampa Arawak: Peru). One sort are nominal 2P clitics which appear in nominal domains. The other sort, at least 25 clausal 2P clitics, appear in clausal domains. Neither sort ever appears in initial position, and may appear between words which otherwise form a syntactic constituent, e.g. [Adj=CL N] in the case of nominal clitics and [Dem=CL N] in the case of clausal clitics. Both sorts allow ""stacking"" (e.g., =ka=mpa=shine=te), but each is subject to distinct constraints on possible hosts. 

We provide an analysis of clausal clitics highlighting the behavior of two subtypes. First, we claim that all Caquinte clitics are prosodically deficient, as evidenced by stress shifts on the stem. We capture this by associating each clitic with a subcategorization frame (w [...]=CL) that indicates that it must have a host to its left, and together they form a phonological word w, following Inkelas (1990) and Bennett, Harizanov, and Henderson (2018), among others. Second, we argue that the [X]=CL constituent is formed via a post-syntactic operation and not through syntactic movement, supported by the fact that clitics can break up syntactic constituents. Third, we argue that clausal clitics are merged at different points on the clausal spine, which accounts for the distribution of the two clausal clitic subtypes. Taken together, 2P clitics stand at the intersection of syntax, morphology, and phonology, and constitute an essential case study of interface phenomena.",0
"The vast majority of roots in English show uniform selectional properties across their various instantiations in verbs, nouns, or adjectives: rely_V on, reliance_N on, reliant_A on. This paper reports a new discovery: there are more than a hundred roots that display nonuniform selectional behavior. Their selectional class depends on whether the root is realized as a verb, a noun, or an adjective: pride_V oneself on, pride_N in, proud_A of. I argue that this is best modeled if the categorizing node itself determines selection.",1
"I investigate non-culminating, zero change-of-state construals of causative verbs in Indonesian. This reading is possible with agents, but not with causers, supporting the Agent Control Hypothesis (Demirdache and Martin 2015). I suggest an analysis of this pattern drawing on Martin's (2019) theory of causation; agentive causation is tokenized by two sub-event tokens – agent's action and theme's change-of-state – whereas non-agentive causation is tokenized only by the second token. This analysis is supported by different interpretations of the two causation types under time-frame adverbials and as complements of aspectual predicates. I hint at the possibility of integrating this analysis within the Tripartite VP Structure (Pyllkanen 2002; Harley
2009, among others).",0
"Over the last 25 years or so, researchers working on argument structure and verbal meanings have
accumulated a growing body of evidence that what appears to be a morphophonologically single verb
is in fact decomposed into a series of semantically contentful functional projections and roots (Hale
and Keyser 1993, Harley 1995, 2002, Kratzer 1996, Beck and Johnson 2004, to mention a few; see
Harley 2012 for a recent summary), suggesting a return to a sharply constrained minimalist syntactic
version of the deep insights of Generative Semantics (Morgan 1969; Lakoff 1970; McCawley 1971).
In this paper, we will furnish novel evidence for this decompositional theory of verb meanings
through a previously unexplored angle of VP-ellipsis. Our central observation is that VP-ellipsis can
target a sub-lexical constituent of a verb's structured meaning. We formulate a condition on
VP-ellipsis that makes crucial reference to a superset-subset relation between the syntactic structures
of the antecedent and the elided constituent. We then use this condition on VP-ellipsis as a probe into
the articulated internal structure of VPs, (dis-)confirming particular decompositional analyses for
controversial cases of verbs such as kill, want, give, open, melt, etc.
A number of important implications arise from this work. Firstly, because the superset-subset
relation makes reference to (morpho-)syntactic identity, the data reported here constitute a powerful
argument that ellipsis must be sensitive to syntactic structure, not just phonological identity, as argued
in Goldberg (2005). Secondly, roots (or at least indices) must be present in the syntactic representation
(Harley 2004) to evaluate proper containment relations between the antecedent-ellipsis pairs for verbs
that show the causative-inchoative alternation, contra researchers who argue that roots are inserted late
post-syntactically (Halle and Marantz 1993; Marantz 1995; Haugen 2009; Haugen and Siddiqi 2013).
Lastly, granted that decompositional effects of verbs are real, the question remains whether the
relevant decomposition takes place in the syntax or at some other pre-syntactic level of representation
such as the GB-style lexicon or the so-called Lexical Conceptual Structure (Pustejovsky 1991; Levin
and Rappaport-Hovav 1995). Our results reported here show that the decomposition in question must
be represented within syntax, a theoretical conclusion that is also echoed in von Stechow (1995) and
Beck and Johnson (2004) in their analyses of scope ambiguities with again in double object verbs.",0
"The title of Myers (2019) [The grammar of Chinese characters, Routledge] is meant literally: Chinese characters really do seem to have a mentally active and productive grammar, with striking similarities to the morphology and phonology of signed and spoken languages. This paper simply sketches out the key points made in the book, one section per chapter. Section 1 outlines previous analyses of Chinese characters, which already reveal grammar-like properties. Section 2 argues that characters have morphological operations akin to affixation, compounding, and reduplication. Section 3 argues that characters also have phonology (of a silent sort, as in sign languages), which describes abstract formal regularities in strokes and overall character shape. Section 4 provides corpus-based evidence for the productivity of many of the above regularities, and Section 5 provides experimental evidence. Section 6 first considers possible explanations for character grammar and then sketches out how the idea might be useful beyond theoretical linguistics.",0
"This paper investigates the limits on word formation by looking at periphrastic (V+aux) and agglutinating (V+suffix) verb patterns.  I propose that creating syntactic words is limited by phase boundaries and that language variation comes from (i) whether Tense/Mood/Aspect elements can or cannot be  part of the verbal phase  and (ii) the availability of post-syntactic rebracketing, creating syntax-phonology mismatches. 

This is investigated on the case of Turkish and to some extent Japanese verbal morphology, by  looking at phonological processes (i.e., stress assignment, pitch accent, vowel harmony) and syntactic processes (ie., coordination, movement).",0
"This paper has a two-fold goal. First, it attempts to argue that the circumfixal nature of the negative morpheme in Moroccan Arabic supports the existence of impenetrable (cyclic) domains, as in Chomsky's (2001) Derivation by Phase. The second goal is to propose a principled account of the long-standing puzzle of the co-occurrence restriction holding between the post-verbal negative marker {-ʃ} and negative polarity items in an adjacent domain. Applying the precepts of Distributed Morphology, my proposal consists of formalizing this restriction in the form of a general constraint banning the realization of multiple negative morphemes in the same spell-out domain, with the effects being the deletion of the post-verbal negative marker. This is achieved via postulating postsyntactic morphological operations. I show that this prediction is not only borne out in MA but also cross-linguistically.",0
"The phenomenon of case has been studied widely at both the descriptive and theoretical levels. Typological work on morphological case systems has provided a picture of the variability of case cross-linguistically. In particular, languages may differ with respect to whether or not arguments are marked with overt morphological case, the inventory of cases with which they may be marked, and the alignment of case marking (e.g. nominative-accusative vs. ergative-absolutive). In the theoretical realm, not only has morphological case been argued to play a role in multiple syntactic phenomena, but current generative work also debates the role of abstract case (i.e. Case) in the grammar: abstract case features have been proposed to underlie morphological case, and to license nominals in the derivation.

The phenomenon of case has been argued to play a role in at least three areas of the syntax: (i) agreement, (ii) A-movement, and (iii) A'-movement. Bobaljik (2008) provides convincing evidence that morphological case-rather than grammatical function-determines a nominal argument's eligibility to participate in verbal agreement. Preminger (2014), building upon Bobaljik's work, claims that languages vary as to whether movement to subject position is case-sensitive. As for case-sensitive A'-movement, recent literature debates whether this phenomenon should be seen as another instance of 'case discrimination' (Deal 2016c) or whether the pattern arises from other properties of ergative languages (e.g. Henderson and Coon 2016). Finally, other recent work (e.g. Brown 2016) has examined agreement and A' extraction patterns in languages with no visible case morphology (e.g. Mayan, Tsimshianic, and Salishan languages). It is shown that the presence of patterns and typological gaps-both in languages with overt morphological case and in those without it-lends support to the relevance of abstract case in the syntax.",0
"In San Juan Atitan Mam (SJA Mam), polar questions are expressed by the second position clitic =m. This clitic can attach to a plethora of categories by means of Local Dislocation (Embick and Noyer 2001). However, =m never attaches to the right of another clitic. This pattern raises two important theoretical issues for Distributed Morphology (DM; Halle and Marantz (1993)). The first is whether or not the clitic status of a morpheme is encoded in the grammar. The second is the need for a theory of possible hosts for clitics. Based on the SJA Mam data, I conclude that the linearization instructions for the polar question clitic must reference the clitic status of its host, suggesting that clitics are different in crucial ways from other morphemes in the grammar.",0

"This dissertation probes the nature of the syntactic operation of Agree through the lens of the morphosyntax of Amahuaca, an endangered Panoan language of the Peruvian Amazon. I take as my empirical focus two interrelated case studies in Amahuaca syntax: 1) the split ergative case system, and 2) the extensive switch-reference system. In the domain of case, I argue that overt ergative case morphology in Amahuaca expones agreement of the transitive subject with multiple functional heads. This leads to a distinction between the features needed for abstract ergative case (agreement only with v), and the features needed to trigger overt ergative case (agreement with both v and T). This distinction between abstract and morphological case factors into the analysis of the switch-reference system of Amahuaca, which I argue is sensitive to abstract case. In addition to case-sensitivity, Amahuaca's switch-reference system shows the typologically unusual property of tracking the reference of all arguments of the verb, not only subjects. I propose that this system arises through adjunct complementizer agreement that probes both the adjunct and matrix arguments directly through cyclic expansion of the probe. Through these two investigations, I conclude that Amahuaca provides support for a narrowly cyclic model of Agree in which each instance of Merge defines a new cycle of Agree (Rezac 2003, 2004; Béjar and Rezac 2009). Further, the empirical facts can be most straightforwardly accounted for if we assume that some probes are insatiable, agreeing with all possible goals in their search space (Deal 2015b). Finally, despite the fact that some agreement in Amahuaca appears to be long distance, I argue that the data can be captured under the fairly conservative assumption that Agree is always under c-command and is always phase-bound.",0
"This dissertation explores the syntactic structures of Uyghur multi-verb constructions formed using the verb-linking -(i)p suffix. In such constructions, only the final verb is inflected for tense, and -(i)p attaches to all non-final verbs in lieu of tense inflection. In some cases, the final verb is semantically bleached of its lexical meaning. I demonstrate that not all -(i)p constructions share a uniform structure; instead, they are formed through a variety of syntactic derivations involving adjunction, coordination or complementation. The -(i)p marker overtly realizes an Event head outside the verbal domain or an Inner Aspect head within the verbal domain whenever a structural configuration blocks one verb's access to Tense inflection. The findings in this dissertation provide novel evidence for two event-related syntactic projections, and show that they can play a crucial role in allowing multiple verbs to appear within a clause. The study also demonstrates that there is no uniform syntactic structure for serial verb constructions. Instead, the way serial verb or other multi-verb constructions are formed is constrained by event structure.",0
"Negative markers are not a uniform category. They come in various types and, depending on their type, they take scope over a clause, a phrase or just a word. Low scope negative markers (LSN) like ""de-, dis-, un-, iN-, non-, -less"" are bound morphemes and have therefore been mainly studied within morphology, focussing on the semantics of these markers (contradiction vs. contrariety), issues related to their productivity, and their combinability with certain categories. Wide scope negative markers (WSN), like ""not"" are often free morphemes, and are usually treated within syntax. We could thus say that there is a morphology-syntax divide when it comes to the treatment of negative markers. 

However, there are reasons to give up this divide and to uniformly treat negative markers within one module of the grammar. First, from a typological point of view the bound-free divide of negative markers does not correlate with their scope. For instance, agglutinative languages have WSN markers that are bound morphemes attaching to the verbal base. Second, morphological processes, like suppletion or other types of allomorphy, can be observed in markers that show properties of WSN markers. Third, independent negative particles, like for instance the Dutch free morpheme ""weinig"" `little, few', shares stacking properties with other LSN markers like un- and iN-. Fourth, both LSN and WSN markers are subject to the same constraint concerning stacking scopally identical negative markers. Fifth, syncretisms have been found across languages between WSN and LSN, allowing negative markers to be ordered in such a way that no *ABA patterns arise, suggesting that the morphology of negative markers reflects the natural scope of negation and that there is a continuum between LSN and WSN markers.",0

An overview article on syncretism.,1
"In Estonian, some objects of verbs show an alternation in case-marking that seems to be conditioned by morphological number: genitive when singular, nominative when plural. According to traditional descriptions (Erelt et al. 1993, 2000) and some recent research (Miljan & Cann 2013), these objects are genitive ominative syntactically and morphologically. This paper argues against this approach, proposing instead that these cases are the morphological realization of a non-autonomous syntactic accusative case, on the basis of two novel arguments. First, although isolated words in the language have no unique accusative form, the pseudopartitive construction does exhibit a unique form in would-be accusative contexts. Second, the genitive form of the inanimate relative pronoun (mille) can be replaced by nominative/unmarked mis, but only when it is in an object position. Though it has been proposed in the literature that Estonian has an accusative case (Hiietam 2003, 2005, Caha 2009), neither of these arguments has been discussed, and they provide compelling morphosyntactic evidence in favor of the proposal. Possible paths to an analysis of the accusative's pervasive syncretism are discussed in the framework of Distributed Morphology. It is proposed that an analysis making use of Impoverishment is superior to one without. The investigation here constitutes an additional case study in the divide between syntactic case and morphological case (Deal 2016, Goddard 1982, Legate 2008, 2014, Spencer 2006).",0

"The paper investigates the syntax of an indirect causative construction,
""make""-causatives in Sason Arabic (SA), with a focus on the syntactic
status of the implicit embedded agent and the embedded structure. Differing
from the analyses of other languages for similar constructions, the study
demonstrates that this construction embeds both an active and passive VoiceP.
It contends that the implicit embedded agent may be introduced (i) as a full DP
in Spec,VoiceP, being subject to Romance ECM-type restrictions, and providing
striking evidence of A'-movement feeding licensing relationships, or (ii) as
a free variable à la Heim (1982) generated in the Voice head itself. The latter
possibility also raises implications regarding licensing, suggesting that licensing
of a grammatical object is dissociated from the projection of a specifier.",0
"In a series of papers Hankamer and Mikkelsen develop an analysis of Danish definiteness marking in Distributed Morphology. They propose that Vocabulary Items that realize the definite determiner are sensitive to whether their complement is a minimal projection of N. In this reply, I discuss a central theoretical problem for this analysis: Under standard assumptions in Distributed Morphology, no other nominal morphology can be derived in the syntax. I propose an alternative analysis that still relies on competition between Vocabulary Items, but the vocabulary is sensitive to immediate asymmetric c-command rather than sisterhood to a minimal N.",0
"The paper proposes a theory of actuality entailments built on two generalizations. The first generalization concerns the kind of root modals that give rise to actuality entailments. These modals have a specific flavor (accessibility relation). For them the prejacent should describe an event caused by the modal state and intended to happen by an implicit Agent. The second generalization concerns the contexts that trigger actuality entailments. Across various languages with different aspectual systems actuality entailing modals give rise to their actuality entailments only under perfective aspects. This makes them descriptively telic. The proposed analysis consists of three stipulations. Firstly, root modals return a predicate of events and describe various modal states. Secondly, root accessibility relations are relations between events (root modals quantify over possible events). Thirdly, one of these relations involves intentional causation. Root modals that take this relation quantify over the set of events that are caused by the modal state and are intended to happen by an implicit Agent. These modals are actuality entailing, that is, telic. For them the relation between the modal state and the prejacent is the same as the relation between the Mary-walking event and the Mary-being-at-Harvard event in the denotation of the telic verb phrase 'Mary walk to Harvard'.",1
"Nepali presents with a complex case marking pattern in which ergative case is obligatory in perfective transitive clauses, disallowed in unaccusative intransitive clauses and copular clauses, and varies with the nominative elsewhere. Where ergative marking is variable, its usage correlates with a variety of semantic and pragmatic factors. The purpose of this investigation is to precisely delineate the grammatical domains for which ergative marking is variable and to provide a unified analysis of the semantic and pragmatic factors that correlate with its expression.

The study of pragmatic phenomena requires the implementation of multiple strategies for collecting language data. The data for this investigation come from four converging lines of inquiry: descriptions of the Nepali pattern in the literature, targeted elicitations with thirteen native speakers, the implementation of a grammaticality judgment survey in Kathmandu in 2016, and the analysis of a published corpus of spoken Nepali.

The analysis found ergative marking to be obligatory in perfective main clauses and variable in subordinate clauses. What appears to be active marking in intransitive clauses is analyzed as ergative marking in transitive clauses with covert objects. The only categorical split is the distinction between perfective and non-perfective verb forms. Every other association was found to be non-categorical.

These non-categorical associations include a positive correlation between subjects with inanimate reference and the expression of ergativity in common nouns, and a
negative correlation between first person pronouns and ergativity in the pronominal domain. This follows expected patterns of marking based on the types which are most frequent in discourse. Ergative marking is somewhat associated with highly individuated objects, but not with affected objects.

Ergative marking is positively associated with characterizing or individual-level predicates, kind readings, categorical propositions, and strong construals of quantifiers. There was no correlation found between ergative marking and agency or volitionality.

The unified analysis of these associations contributes to theories of Optional Ergative Marking and to optional case marking systems in general. The main claim is that the Nepali ergative marks an effector of the event described by the clause. This term refers to a participant which is implicated in enacting and effecting the event, but is not necessarily its main controller or instigator. As a component of the ergative case marking system, it has a pragmatic usage, implicating the subject as a participant in a prototypically transitive event. Aspects of this analysis contribute to the general theory of Optional Ergative Marking and its relation to argument proto-roles. Associations between the ergative and prototypical properties of a transitive event arise from the meaning of the ergative marker as an effector. This analysis also provides a straightforward explanation for the lack of volitional correlations in Nepali that we find in other languages with variable ergativity.

Other semantic and pragmatic features are associated with discourse prominence. These include the correlation with categorical propositions and characterizing predicates. Here the associations are attributable to general principles of semantic markedness. Variable ergativity represents the presence of pragmatic implicatures of various strengths. Gradient markedness oppositions can lead to the conventionalization of these associations into semantic entailments. This is demonstrated for English gender marking, the association between ergative marking and semantic properties of the transitive subject in Nepali, and the association between ergative marking and Nepali perfective verb forms.",0
"This paper provides further evidence that the Person Case Constraint (PCC) in Romance is not limited to clitic clusters. Previously, this has been shown for Spanish (Ormazabal and Romero 2013), but I show that, in Italian, French, and Catalan causatives, a 1st/2nd person direct object is incompatible not only with dative clitics but also with full dative arguments (see also Postal 1989, Bonet 1991). This is different from the manifestation of the PCC in ditransitive contexts where only dative clitics are ruled out. The difference follows, I argue, if ditransitives in these languages have two underlying structures so that a DP introduced by 'a/à' can be either dative or locative, in line with broader cross-linguistic patterns (see Harley 2002; Demonte 1995, Cuervo 2003 on Spanish; Anagnostopoulou 2003, Fournier 2010 on French; Holmberg, Sheehan & van der Wal 2018 on Italian). For this reason, indirect object DPs marked with a/à must trigger PCC effects in causatives but not in ditransitives, as only in the former are they unambiguously dative. Further support for this claim comes from Spanish, a language which morphologically distinguishes locative vs. dative phrases in ditransitives via clitic doubling (Cuervo 2003) and which shows PCC effects with all animate direct objects (Ormazabal and Romero 2007, 2013). I show that these facts are compatible with approaches to the PCC based on intervention (Anagnostopoulou 2003, 2005 amongst others), but raise challenges for those which rely crucially on the weak/clitic status of datives (Bianchi 2006, Stegovec 2017).",0
"This thesis concerns case-marking phenomena in Icelandic and Faroese. I argue that the best approach to case distinguishes the levels of abstract, morphosyntactic and morphological case, and permits mismatches between levels in some grammars (Linking Theory, Kiparsky 1997, 2001); these mismatches are best handled by an Optimality Theoretic output harmonisation on the mapping from argument structure to morphosyntax (Prince and Smolensky 1993 et seq.). Such a theory provides a cogent account of predicates with non-nominative subjects in Insular Scandinavian, which present an interesting puzzle: in Icelandic, dative-subject verbs occur with nominative objects that trigger number agreement, whereas in Faroese the object in such sentences is marked accusative and occurs with default third person singular agreement. To date this difference has been poorly understood, and calls for in-depth analysis. The central hypothesis explored in this thesis is that the patterns observed are not language-specific idiosyncrasies, but the outcome of constraint interactions of a typical kind: namely, a pressure to index a nominative argument in the clause by number agreement, and a pressure to express structural accusative case on the object. I argue that similar constraint conflicts are responsible for the loss of lexical case in phenomena such as nominative substitution and case non-preservation, and correctly predict the availability of the passive in dative-subject predicates. I include a substantial amount of new data from surveys conducted on the Faroe Islands and Iceland, which are consistent with my hypothesis, and shed new light on the case systems of these languages beyond simple monotransitives. Moreover, I propose a Competing Grammars Model of intra-linguistic variation (cf. Kroch 1989 et seq.), which finds empirical support in corpora, and offers a plausible framework for explaining the diachronic trajectory of these languages. Finally, the model of grammar proposed here is also cross-linguistically tractable, generating realistic typologies of case-related phenomena, and can easily be extended to other language families.",0
"This dissertation explores the interaction of reduplication and segmental mutation. Previous studies have shown that both mutation and reduplication can be understood as purely phonological operations in response to defective segmental and prosodic material. Cases of over- and underapplication in reduplicated structures, however, pose a serious challenge to phonological accounts and are apparently better handled by non-modular approaches that invoke morpheme-specific constraints or construction-specific cophonologies. The main goal of this dissertation is to show that a phonological account of over- and underapplication of segmental mutation is not only feasible but that seemingly opaque interactions are in fact predicted by mixed representational-serial approaches. Following the broad research program of Generalized Non-Linear Affixation, and assuming a modular feed-forward architecture of grammar, I demonstrate how apparent cases of overapplication (including ``backcopying'') follow from the interplay of markedness conspiracies, copying of non-minimal prosodic domains, and phonological stratification. Underapplication, on the other hand, emerges from a shortage of mutation triggers, either due to excessive underspecification or as a direct consequence of minimal copying. In addition, I offer reanalyses of purported cases of suppletive allomorphy in reduplication in terms of complex, yet fully transparent segmental phonological alternations. The dissertation thus strengthens the general argument for item-based approaches to non-concatenative morphology and advocates a strictly modular architecture as an alternative to lexical indexation.",0
"The notion of uniformitarianism, originally borrowed into linguistics from the earth sciences, is widely considered to be a foundational principle in modern historical linguistics. However, there are almost as many interpretations of uniformitarianism as there are historical linguists who take the time to define the notion. In this paper I argue, following Gould (1965; 1987), that this confusion results from the fact that uniformitarianism as originally proposed in geology is not itself a uniform notion, and permits at least four readings. Only some of these readings involve substantive claims rather than methodological imperatives, and only some of these readings are useful for the study of language change. The weakest conclusion to be drawn is that these distinct notions need to be kept apart when invoked by historical linguists.",0
"This dissertation is an in-depth investigation of DP structure in Kipsigis, an extremely understudied Southern Nilotic language spoken in Kenya. All data come from original fieldwork, and the theoretical focus is on the following three broad areas: number morphology, the syntax of adjectives, and the syntax of determiner spreading.


Kipsigis has a tripartite system of number marking: some nouns are morphologically unmarked in the singular and form their plural with a plural suffix, some nouns are unmarked in the plural and form their singular with a singulative suffix, while a third class of nouns always have a singulative suffix in the singular, and a plural suffix in the plural. I argue that this pattern is due to the existence of a noun classification system based on number features on little n, which interact with number features on Num in a way that generates the three types of number marking. My analysis corroborates the existence of number-based noun classification, which has been argued before for Tanoan languages (Harbour 2007). I also show that the Kipsigis morphological number classes are orthogonal to the mass/count distinction in the language, contra Grimm's (2012; 2018) claims for Nilo-Saharan. Finally, I argue that the term 'singulative' is misleading, with at least two types of singulatives cross-linguistically: true allomorphs of singular (e.g., in Kipsigis) or morphemes with a classifier-like function in the syntax (e.g., in Ojibwe).


Adjectives in Kipsigis can only modify a noun as predicates inside a relative clause, despite overwhelming evidence that they constitute a morhosyntactic category distinct from (stative) verbs in the language. The Kipsigis data, thus, provide strong support for Baker's (2003a) claims that adjectives are a universal lexical category and that direct nominal modification is not their flagship property. They also support a separationist view of adjectival syntax, along the lines of Cinque's (2010) – among many others – direct vs. indirect modification distinction, and provide clear evidence for the analysis of the latter type of adjectives in terms of a relative clause structure. Kipsigis is also added to a list of languages that completely lack direct modification adjectives, and I briefly discuss why the syntax of direct modification might be unavailable in some languages.


In Kipsigis each adjective or full relative clause that modifies the noun must be preceded by one of four determiners; three of these determiners are demonstratives, making Kipsigis a rare example of a language with demonstrative spreading (as opposed to the common spreading of definite articles; cf. Alexiadou 2014). I argue that the complex distribution of these determiners is best captured by an analysis of relative clauses as D's with a clausal complement (Kayne 1994 among others), with my analysis of determiner spreading being close to Alexiadou & Wilder's (1998) analysis of determiner spreading in Greek. I discuss the implications of the Kipsigis data for the typology of determiner spreading (also called definiteness agreement in the literature), and I conclude that a relative clause structure is key to the understanding of the phenomenon, even in languages that are often analyzed in terms of agreement/concord (e.g., many Semitic languages). Finally, I show that demonstratives in Kipsigis are best analyzed as D heads, and conclude that demonstratives can be either heads or phrasal depending on the language.",0
"This dissertation explores the relation between the notion of subjecthood and syntactic ergativity through the lens of West Circassian (or Adyghe; of the Northwest Caucasian family), a polysynthetic morphologically ergative language. West Circassian displays a number of unusual syntactic ergativity effects, i.e. effects which indicate that the absolutive argument occupies the structurally prominent position which is generally believed to be associated with subjecthood. Through the close examination of two such effects – reciprocal binding patterns and constraints on parasitic gap licensing – I arrive at the conclusion that the absolutive argument in West Circassian may be generated in a variety of positions within the verbal theta-domain, but then uniformly undergoes A-movement to the highest argument position in the clause regardless of its theta-role. 
The derived status of the high absolutive explains why a number of subjecthood diagnostics, such as reflexive binding and obligatory control configurations, single out the ergative agent as the subject: this is because the syntactic properties of these constructions rely on the voice projection, which is merged directly above the verbal theta-domain, i.e. vP. Given the low position of Voice0, diagnostics which involve the use of this head single out the highest argument in vP as the subject, rather than the highest argument in the full clause. The proposed analysis provides support for the idea that subjecthood properties may be disbursed across several positions – in a syntactically ergative language like West Circassian, these positions are often occupied by two distinct nominals. In the absence of a single position or single nominal which could be labeled as a subject within a given clause structure, the term 'subject' becomes theoretically vacuous. 
The dissertation provides insight into the nature of syntactic ergativity, the structural status of subjecthood, and the syntax of anaphor binding, parasitic gap licensing and obligatory control constructions. Through the examination of argument asymmetries in a polysynthetic language, this project contributes to the line of research demonstrating that polysynthesis and non-configurationality cannot be defined macro-parametrically, but are rather a consequence of several micro-parameters at play, and that there is configurational structure at the core of such a language.",0
"West Circassian displays prominent polysynthetic morphology both in the verbal and nominal domains and both syntactic categories are subject to the same morphological ordering constraints. I argue that despite these similarities, nominal and verbal wordforms in West Circassian are in fact constructed via two distinct word formation processes: while the verbal root and any accompanying functional morphology are pronounced as a single phonological word by virtue of forming a single complex syntactic head via head movement, the nominal head and its modifiers are pronounced as a single word due to rules of syntax-to-prosody mapping. Such a division of labor provides an account for why only nouns, and not verbs, exhibit productive noun incorporation in the language: West Circassian noun incorporation is prosodic, rather than syntactic. The evidence for the existence of these two avenues of word formation comes from a systematic violation of morpheme ordering observed in verbal nominalizations. In terms of broader theoretical impact, the proposed analysis provides insight into what factors shape a polysynthetic language: while it is tempting to reduce polysynthetic morphology to either simple head movement or just a consequence of mapping complex syntactic structure to a single phonological word without any head movement, the West Circassian data show that neither of these mechanisms can be dispensed of.",0
"Abstract
The aim of this paper is to give some information about Amharic-English code-switching. It addresses different issues in related with Amharic-English code-switching. Amharic is SOV language, whereas English is SVO language. 
Since Ethiopia is a multilingual country, code-switching is obviously known between different language speakers. Especially the educated people is mostly switch a code to English while speaking Amharic. And Amharic is serving as a lingua franca and the working language of the federal government for this multilingual nation-Ethiopia. Therefore, some linguistic issues in Amharic-English code-switching are raised in this paper.
According to Kiranmayi, N.C (2010) code-switching is mixing more than one language by bilinguals or multilinguals in a discourse. Code-switching is existing between two or more bilingual or multilingual speakers. When they are speaking together they may use different languages in alternative way. Someone may code-switches using two different languages (Interlingua) or different dialects of the same language (intralingua) interchangeably in a single communication. 
Code-switching may occur in different linguistic aspects in both conversational functions and structural aspects like to indicate a direct quotation, reported speech, interjection, reiteration, message qualification, referential and idiomatic expressions, content and system morpheme distinction, syntactic categories and frequency of switched segments, universal constraints, etc.",0
"Traditional analyses of do-support share two core properties: i) they link do-support with the inability of the verb to form a relation with an inflectional head, such as T (e.g. via head movement or lowering), and ii) they posit a constraint that requires the inflectional head to combine with a verb (Lasnik 1981, Halle and Marantz 1993, Bobaljik 1995). Based on crosslinguistic data, we argue against both aspects of the traditional view. First, it incorrectly predicts that V-to-T movement and do-support should not cooccur in a language. And second, it does not capture crosslinguistic generalizations about which inflectional heads are supported by do. We develop an analysis of do-support as the outcome of chain splitting, in which a relation between V and T is successfully established and only later split. The successful formation of a head chain (containing V, T, and possibly other heads) accounts for the fact that languages with V-to-T movement may exhibit do-support, and derives the attested do-insertion positions from independent properties of head chains in a given language.",0
"This talk uses survey results and mapping tools to analyze correlations across different versions of the non-standard verbal use of the word rather, in particular with participial morphology, as in rathered. Across numerous possible instantiations of the construction, there appear to be in fact a quite limited number of grammars, which are generated by an implicational hierarchy of functional heads, along with the availability of a silent verb HAVE. The overall picture supports several broader conclusions. First, silent verbs can be licensed by head-moving to a modal head in the extended projection. This movement is freely available, but silence demands recoverability, which limits its application only to certain verbs, and certain uses/meanings of those verbs. Second, bare-infinitive–selecting verbs are nearly ""closed class"" because they have special syntactic properties that go beyond semantic or even syntactic selection: They must license the temporal verbal features of the embedded verb, or else provide a structural context for such licensing. Third, in addition to previously known configurations for building parasitic participle constructions, movement of a lower verb to a higher verb can extend the phase of the lower verb and lead to its silent. Fourth, the distribution suggests of rather suggests that volitional meaning is not a primitive, but is constructed from smaller primitives. Finally, microvariation reveals a tight connection among logically distinct functional heads, suggesting that they are not acquired independently of each other, but interact in significant ways.",1
"There is no way to tell systematic from accidental gaps in the (cross-linguistic) record since it cannot be shown that a pattern does not exist: there are many languages we do not know about in past, future and present (on a remote island). Hence the remote island argument which may be levelled against any systematic gap candidate. The chapter reviews the position taken in different quarters regarding the canonical incarnation of systematic gaps, i.e. chomskyan Universal Grammar UG. The remote island is argued to be a non-issue: it is either trivial (if you believe that there are no systematic gaps) or irrelevant (if you believe that systematic gaps exist). Calling on the remote island is like asserting that pink elephants exist: nobody can prove the contrary but the assertion is meaningless for the study of elephants. Finally, UG is criticized because it merely lists things that do not exist without saying why they are absent. Natural constants such as the speed of light c are angle stones of scientific discovery, but nobody knows why they exist or have the value they do. Adult science does not discredit the search for natural constants because they cannot be explained.",0
"There have been a number of studies investigating the phenomenon of t-d deletion in English, the process through which /t/ or /d/ can be deleted in word final Ct or Cd coda clusters. This diverse body of research ranges from sociolinguistic studies examining the role of social factors in deletion variation (such as Guy and Boyd 1990) through to more phonological based analyses. The latter approaches include frequency analyses (such as Bybee 2002) and statistically driven Optimality Theory accounts (such as the Multiple Grammars approach by Kiparsky 1993, for example), as well as more articulatory-based explanations (such as Guy and Boberg 1997, who regard t-d deletion as a result of obligatory contour principle violations). Hierarchies have been constructed of the preceding and following consonants most likely to promote deletion, but each of the studies has concentrated on an individual interpretation of the phenomenon. However, despite the attention paid to this connected speech feature throughout the literature, very little, if any, attention has been paid to the complementary distribution of /t/ and /d/ in monomorphemic final clusters nor their morphological status and the interaction between /t/ deletion and glottalisation in certain environments. For example, the suggestion (Guy 1980 et seq) that the most likely type of preceding sound to promote deletion is a sibilant cannot adequately explain the patterns supplied by English data analysis, as it does not take distribution into account. Thus, this blanket claim fails to observe that, whilst /s/ is overall a promoter, this will only occur before /t/, and that /ʃ/ would only ever occur before /t/ in bimorphemic words. 
Our paper explores both the benefits and the shortcomings of previous work in both American and British English analyses, and presents a new sociophonological analysis using data from a linguistic variety of South-East British English. The initial data discussed here were extracted from casual sociolinguistic interviews of Mersea Island English speakers, and represents both genders and two distinct age groups. A total of 897 tokens were processed for (t) and (d) as individual variables (N= 491 and N=406, respectively) in order to compare and contrast both variables with respect to their morpho-phonological and syntactic distribution, as well as applicable social constraints. While differences in social variation appear minimal, the resulting analysis of linguistic constraints demonstrates the importance of analysing (t) and (d) as separate variables. A comparison thus highlights differing patterns of distribution across linguistic contexts, as well as interactions with other dialectal process (such as /l/ vocalisation), prompting the creation of two separate deletion hierarchies and a number of new analytical perspectives.",1
"This paper explores the consequences that language change might trigger in the languages of crew members during a long journey in space or interplanetary settlement.  Languages drift apart as communities grow more isolated from each other, so the long isolation of a traveling community may lead to enough difference to render its language unintelligible to the original community it left.  This problem may compound as later vessels bring new crews with their own changed languages to mix with those from earlier crews. 

We discuss various aspects that contribute to language change, through comparison to historical Earthbound cases involving some of these aspects, such as the Polynesian settlement of far-flung Pacific islands, and dialect development in relatively isolated European colonies. We also weigh the effects of multilingualism amongst the crew, with or without a common lingua franca in use, as well as the effects of time and the role that children play in language change and creation.  As we lay out possible outcomes, we also suggest possible methods of shaping this development within limits.",0

"Heads are commonly assumed to be able to serve as probes in Agree relationships, but maximal projections are commonly assumed not to be able to. Based on evidence from Coahuilteco---an extinct language isolate formerly spoken in southwest Texas---I suggest that maximal projections may enter into Agree. Coahuilteco exhibits an unusual pattern of subject-object concord, in which internal arguments consistently inflect based on the phi-features of the external argument. This can receive a simple explanation as a case of the sharing of phi-features between subject and object under Agree, provided maximal projections may serve both as probes and goals. I show that this marker is indeed a morpheme which attaches to the object, and argue against a possible alternative in which a mediating functional head in the verbal complex is responsible for the transmission of phi-features from the subject to object. If correct, this analysis has a number of implications for syntactic theory more generally, some of which I highlight.",0
"In this article, we take a detailed look at clausal ellipsis in Icelandic, a hitherto understudied phenomenon. We focus on case-matching and case-mismatching facts in fragment responses. We argue that although case-matching is the norm, constrained instances of case-mismatching strongly suggest that there must be silent structure in the ellipsis site, and some syntactic identity condition. We outline these patterns in detail, and provide an analysis that assumes a post-syntactic approach to case-marking, and a hybrid identity condition along the lines of Chung (2013).",1
"In this squib, we propose a new generalization concerning the structural relationship between theta assigners and heads showing morpho-phonologically overt agreement, when the two interact with the same argument DP.
This structural generalization bears directly on the proper modeling of syntactic agreement, as well as the prospects for reducing other syntactic (and syntacto-semantic) dependencies to the same underlying mechanism.

"This paper presents new empirical evidence for a particular version of the asymmetric approach to across-the-board (ATB) movement. The evidence comes from reflexes of movement, a diagnostic tool that has not been used so far in the ATB-literature. I investigate languages in which the reflex shows a morphological distinction between terminal and intermediate movement steps. The existing approaches of ATB make different predictions about the distribution of such reflexes across the conjuncts under long-distance ATB-movement. The data collected from 4 Niger-Congo languages provide evidence for asymmetric extraction from the 1st conjunct + a terminal movement step inside the 2nd conjunct. Furthermore, the observed asymmetry between long and short ATB-movement regarding the distribution of the reflexes (symmetric vs. asymmetric) is derived by the standard relativized minimality condition on syntactic operations, here on upward probing, combined with the assumption that PF-lowering also applies in an ATB-fashion.",0
"In their keynote article, Polinsky and Scontras highlight intriguing behavioral similarities between heritage language use and monolingual development. Given this, I wonder if we can leverage existing comparative, behavioral, and computational approaches that are currently deployed to understand monolingual development in order to better understand heritage languages. I sketch out a few instances of each developmental approach, based on the concrete examples Polinsky and Scontras discuss of heritage language use.",0
"Cognitive science applies diverse tools and perspectives to study human language. Recently, an exciting body of work has examined linguistic phenomena through the lens of efficiency in usage: what otherwise puzzling features of language find explanation in formal accounts of how language might be optimized for communication and learning? Here, we review studies that deploy formal tools from probability and information theory to understand how and why language works the way that it does, focusing on phenomena ranging from the lexicon through syntax. These studies show how a pervasive pressure for efficiency guides the forms of natural language and indicate that a rich future for language research lies in connecting linguistics to cognitive psychology and mathematical theories of communication and inference.",0
"This paper argues that the ordering of slots in the Algonquian verb inflection template reflects a combination of syntactic and morphological principles. The overall order of slots parallels the order of functional heads in the syntactic structure. However, not every slot corresponds to a distinct syntactic terminal. Some terminals undergo fission (Noyer 1992), giving rise to situations in which a sequence of morphological slots corresponds to a single syntactic terminal. The paper proposes a syntax-morphology mapping for all of the slots in the Algonquian verb inflection template, distinguishing slots that realize distinct syntactic terminals from slots that realize the same terminal via fission. Several criteria that can help to distinguish between these alternatives are suggested.",0
"In this paper I will provide a new argument for post-syntactic morphology. The empirical evidence comes from so-called displaced morphology in German verb clusters, where the non-ﬁnite verb form selected by a given governor does not appear on the immediately dependent verb but rather on the linearly last verb of the selector's complement. The placement of the morphology thus partly depends on linear notions and not exclusively on hierarchical relations. I will provide an analysis within Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz in The view from Building 20. Essays in linguistics
in honour of Sylvain Bromberger, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, pp 111–176, 1993), where exponents for non-ﬁnite morphology are inserted into separate functional heads which are linearized after their VP-complements. At a late stage of the PF-derivation, the exponents are associated with their verbal hosts by means of Local Dislocation, an operation that applies under adjacency (Embick and Noyer in Linguist Inq 32(4):555–595, 2001). As a consequence, the non-ﬁnite morphology always comes last in the selector's complement. Displacement arises once the immediately dependent verb is
not the last verbal element in the complement of its selector; this is generally the case in strictly ascending orders, while in the strictly descending 321 order the morphology is faithfully realized. The placement operation is thus always the same, displacement only emerges as a side effect of certain cluster orders. Further evidence for a post-syntactic approach to the placement of non-ﬁnite morphology and against a pre-
syntactic perspective comes from the absence of semantic effects under displacement, the emergence of non-ﬁnite verb forms speciﬁed for more than one non-ﬁnite category under multiple displacement and the distribution of default forms.",0
"Despite claims of the existence of phonological processes that apply strictly in limited morphosyntactic domains, recent corpus and experimental findings suggest that such processes are unproductive and difficult to learn. Martin (2011) and Chong (2017) consequently posit learning models having a generality bias, such that they cannot acquire morphosyntactically specific restrictions without supporting statistical tendencies from other domains. This article presents a corpus study of Malagasy backness dissimilation, showing that it applies consistently and exclusively to the passive imperative suffix, the only suffix eligible to undergo it. Dissimilation was extended to loanwords having the suffix and has persisted for multiple generations, but is entirely unsupported by the lexicon, which instead displays a phonotactic harmony tendency. These findings suggest that no degree of generality is necessary for learning. Rather, if the bias is active, then it must be overridable.",1
"Recent work on verb clusters within Continental West-Germanic has argued in favor of restrictive theories of cluster orders that only generate a subset of the logically possible orders in three-verb clusters, explicitly ruling out the 213 order. In this context it is remarkable that Swiss German features a verb cluster-like construction with an unmarked 213 order. I will argue that this construction indeed represents a proper verb cluster and not an instance of the 3rd Construction, which also allows the 213 order. Based on new diagnostics, viz., stranding of VP3 under topicalization of the
governing VP2, short relative clause extraposition and displaced zu, I will show that verb clusters and Verb Projection Raising differ from the 3rd Construction with respect to the structural position of the dependent VP: while the dependent VP is contained within the projection of the governing verb in the former, it occurs outside of the projection of the governing verb in the latter. Applying the diagnostics to the Swiss German 213 construction delivers a clear result: the construction patterns with verb
clusters rather than the 3rd Construction. I conclude from this that theories of verb clusters and unmarked word order more generally must be able to generate all six logically possible orders, including the 213 order.",0
"This paper reports some of the results of the largest typological study of nominal concord to date. The sample contains 174 languages from 105 distinct families. Concord is found in 59.2% of languages in the sample. I demonstrate a number of tendencies among languages with concord: (i) number concord is the most common type, (ii) gender concord is common among languages with gender, (iii) case concord is relatively rare and almost never occurs alone, and (iv) it is more common to have concord on both adjectives and demonstratives than on just one or the other.

"In this paper, I propose to eliminate T as an independent syntactic head from the computational system of human language. Adopting feature inheritance (Chomsky 2013, 2015) and assuming that tense (and other features, if any) is inherited from C by T, T does not have any contents in lexicon. It is doubtful that T can exist as a legitimate syntactic head, though tense feature definitely exists in human language. Based on Hosono's (2018) analysis on verb movement, I propose that in languages such as French and English, a verbal head moves and merges to the root, and it inherits tense (and any other functional features) after C merges; in V2 languages, a verbal head directly moves to C, and feature inheritance does not occur. In both cases, I argue, the object which has traditionally been called TP is unlabeled. I also introduce the framework of workspace proposed by Chomsky et al. (2017) and Chomsky (2017), who change the definition of the merging operation from Merge to MERGE and claim that only external and internal MERGE are legitimate, rejecting other merging operations, e.g. countercyclic movement such as verb movement. I argue that without T, the problem on the countercyclic property of verb movement is solved.

"This is an encyclopaedia article on agreement seen from the Romance perspective. It includes some of the main syntactic phenomena in Romance that have contributed to the development of the theory of agreement, from PSR to the Minimalist Program.
The topics discussed are: agreement in PSR, past participle agreement, rich agreement and null subjects, the NSP, unaccusativity (shortly), and subject clitics (with tests to determine their pronominal vs inflectional status). 

The list of relevant phenomena is far from complete. Nevertheless, I hope to have selected some key phenomena that were crucial for the development of syntactic and morphological theory, especially within generative grammar.

"This paper provides a morphosyntactic account of particle reduplication in Hungarian, a case of reduplication whose function is to express repetition of events. The most conspicuous property of this process is that it can only apply when the particle is strictly left adjacent to an overt verb. We develop an analysis in terms of a syntactic process that yields a string of doubled particles that do not form a constituent, following the insight of Piñon (1991), and we propose that reduplication targets subwords and derives the facts via a local doubling process.",1

"This paper discusses case marking in mixed verbs in Uyghur-Chinese code switching, where a lexical verb from Mandarin Chinese is combined with a light verb from Uyghur. In mixed verbs containing a Chinese verb whose Uyghur translational equivalent idiosyncratically selects a dative object, the mixed verb also selects a dative object. We analyze this fact by proposing that dative arguments are introduced by an applicative head (Cuervo 2003) whose presence is required by a little v head selecting for certain types of roots along the lines of Merchant (2018).",0
"This paper presents an outlook on 'inherent case' that ties it consistently to the category P, in either of two ways: the inherent case particle is either an autonomous spell-out of P or, in Emonds' (1985, 1987) term, an alternative realisation of a silent P (i.e., a case morpheme on P's nominal complement that licenses the silence of P). The paper also unfolds a perspective on case concord that analyses it as the copying of morphological material rather than the matching of morphological features. These proposals are put to the test in a detailed analysis of the case facts of Estonian, with particular emphasis on the distinction, within its eleven 'semantic' cases, between the seven spatial cases (analysed as alternative realisations of a null P) and the last four cases (treated as autonomous realisations of postpositions). This analysis of the Estonian case system has repercussions for the status of genitive case (structural vs inherent), and for the analysis of (the distribution of) case concord. It also prompts a novel, purely syntactic outlook on case distribution in pseudo-partitives, exploiting a key contrast between Agree and the Spec–Head relation: when agreement involves the Spec–Head relation, it is subject to a TOTAL MATCH condition.",0
"In this paper, I have investigated a directional asymmetry in configurations involving category mismatch, a pattern first noted to the best of my knowledge by Tan (2018), in order to shed light on contemporary debates regarding the locus and nature of identity conditions imposed on VP-ellipsis. The asymmetry states that complex event nominals such as graduate can license ellipsis of its verbal counterpart, but not vice versa. I have argued that this asymmetry can only be accounted for by a morphosyntactic containment condition to the effect that the syntactic structure of an antecedent must properly contain that of an elided constituent. I have further shown that this position receives independent support from Sugimoto's (2018) recent discovery of a similar asymmetry observed with causative alternation verbs such as break and melt, in which the causative vP structure allows the ellipsis of the inchoative VP structure, but not the other way around. The asymmetry under investigation and the analysis thereof furnish an excellent testing ground in favor of an abstract morphosyntactic derivation for zero-derived noun-verb pairs in contemporary syntactic theory, while retaining the important sights from the level-ordering hypothesis of Kiparsky (1982a, b) within his framework of Lexical Phonology.",0
"Causative morphology has been associated with either the introduction of an event of causation or the introduction of a causer argument. However, morphological causatives are mono-eventive, casting doubt on the notion that causatives fundamentally add a causing event. On the other hand, in some languages the causative morpheme is closer to the verb root than would be expected if the causative head is responsible for introducing the causer. Drawing on evidence primarily from Tagalog and Halkomelem, I argue that the syntactic configuration for morphological causatives involves Voice over Voice, and that languages differ in whether their 'causative marker' spells out the higher Voice, the lower Voice or both.",0
"All languages need to counterbalance the necessary re-use of their elementary vocabulary of phonemes, morphemes, and words with the imperative to avoid redundancy. The (hopefully representative and near-exhaustive) list of repetitive phenomena in German that is offered here suggests that German avoids redundancy in the lexicon by rather strictly prohibiting exact adjacent repetition of phonological material. The only cases that may override this ban appear to be abbreviations (BBC, DDR), onomatopoeias (Wauwau), and ideophones (ballaballa). In all other cases, the ban on exact adjacent repetition holds, and it does so across all levels of the phonological hierarchy (segment - syllable - foot - word - phrase).",0
"Changes in the productivity of word-formation patterns are often investigated using hapax legomena. In this paper, I argue that at least in diachronic investigations of productivity, a measure based on first attestations is a viable alternative to hapax-based measures. I show that such a measure is a more direct proxy to new words than hapax-based measures – it measures what we want to measure, which is not always true for the latter. I present a method that deals with the common problem of varying sub-corpus sizes (I suggest we randomly resample the sub-corpora up to a predefined size), and to the problem of old words appearing as new at the start of the corpus (I suggest we take an earlier corpus and determine a point in time when almost all old words have registered). Armed with these instruments, we can determine the ratio of new types to existing types for a time span, which can be regarded as the renewal rate of the respective category.",0
"Abstract
Polish adnominal participles accept a wide range of event modifiers except when they are additionally modified by focus or phase particles corresponding to still. The paper argues that the semantic contribution of still is incompatible with the change-of-state component of the meaning of participles. While still presupposes that the property denoted by the participle holds over the initial proper subinterval during which the focalized state holds, the measure-of-change function found in resultative participles entails that the relevant subinterval corresponds to the change of state over which the relevant property does not hold yet. The participles modifiable by still are argued to lack the change-of-state component.",0
"This paper uses evidence from NCI (n-word) licensing and scope relations to argue that a negative head may appear at four different points within a clause in Uyghur, all of which select a verbal complement. Negative concord occurs when an NCI is c-commanded by verbal negation before spellout. The findings of this paper refute the claim that single negation is a hallmark of monoclausality in multi-verb constructions.",0
"Pater's target article proposes that neural networks will provide theories of learning that generative grammar lacks. We argue that his enthusiasm is premature since the biases of neural networks are largely unknown, and he disregards decades of work on machine learning and learnability. Learning biases form a two-way street: all learners have biases, and those biases constrain the space of learnable grammars in mathematically measurable ways. Analytical methods from the related fields of computational learning theory and grammatical inference allow one to study language learning, neural networks, and linguistics at an appropriate level of abstraction. The only way to satisfy our hunger and to make progress on the science of language learning is to confront these core issues directly.",1
"How morphological elements interact with one another is a major concern
for both morphological theory and typological research. Morphemes, for example, are usually said to block each other when they are in subset-superset relations to one another. Little is known, by contrast, of how morphomes (i.e. forms with unnatural morphosyntactic distributions) interact with one another. This paper provides an initial typology of morphome interactions, based on whether their forms overlap in the paradigm or not, or whether the distribution of one constitutes a subset of the other or not. In addition, special attention will be paid to the outcome or the resolution of morphome orthogonalities. Focusing on the interaction between the L- and N-morphomes of Romance, the analogical changes related to their orthogonality are surveyed and a constraint is proposed that limits the possibilities of morphome interaction.",0
"Linguistics and the science of Anthropology have much in common. In fact, to a large extent the two fields overlap. Field workers utilize research models of the ethnographic type as well as approaches that are experimental, methods that are qualitative as well as quantitative, for example. The study of language contact and bilingualism, topic of this paper, presents a good opportunity for drawing on contributions from the two overlapping fields. The focus of the following review of current research will be mainly from the cognitive science point of view, divided into four areas of recent work: (1) bilingual development, first and second language learning and language loss, (2) creolization and convergence, (3) codeswitching and borrowing, and (4) problems related to the distinction between language and dialect. A guiding concept in better understanding the findings of research in these four areas is the special status of the mother-tongue (child first language). In bilingual communities, children often develop mother-tongue, or native-language level, competence in two languages – the acquisition of two first languages. How is second language learning different, and in what ways will research show that it is similar, or the same? Linguistics in East Asia and in other multilingual regions around the world present us with common research problems in the study of language contact and bilingualism because of notable historical parallels. Some of these parallels can be traced to the movement and settlement of founding populations. The more recent immigration and settlement of newer arriving populations is also comparable in some ways from the point of view of cross-language and cross-cultural interaction. In this regard an especially interesting parallel is that between Taiwan and North and South America. The four sub-topics to be briefly reviewed are closely related. The creation of new languages in creolization and convergence is basically about first and second language learning (#1 and #2 above). Related to the questions in this field, we study codeswitching and borrowing (#3) as an aspect of language contact on different levels: internally between the two mental grammars of the bilingual, and externally in communication with other bilingual individuals. How does this kind of linguistic interaction affect learning, language loss, and possible convergence involving two languages or two dialects? Then, what do we mean when we ask: how is variation from one language to another different from variation within a language? This question (#4) is actually difficult to answer. But it is related to processes of learning and communication between speakers of one language, or dialect, and another. Finally, the comparisons centered on East Asia allow us to study the design features of the most divergent writing systems in use in the world today and how these contrasts might be related to the cross-language interaction issues.",1
"Very early in Middle English, texts especially in the North and East, tend to use an orthographic suffix –(e)s for noun plurals, in Southern and Western texts the plural suffix –(e)n of the Old English weak declension at first spreads, but then by 1300 also yields to –(e)s. This essay first shows that on phonological and phonetic grounds this –(e)s, which remains the productive plural in Modern English, must, as a vocabulary item, be lexically specified as +Voice; it is not voiced by any progressive assimilation process in synchronic derivations. The source of this underlying voiced sibilant –z, completely absent in Old English, is to be found in the genealogical ancestor of Middle English, Proto-Scandinavian, whose plural in all non-neuter declensions is precisely this segment (Haugen 1982). The present essay argues that this form was an integral part of the Norse brought to England by the earliest Scandinavian settlers in the 9th c. In all likelihood, the later change in Mainland Scandinavian of this –z to –r, completed in the 12th c., failed to establish itself in the Anglicized Norse of England, due to sociolinguistic factors akin to those set out in the classic paper of Labov (1963).",0

Tupían languages typically mark evidentiality through freestanding particles located in a predicate- or clause-peripheral position. In Tuparí, however, non-witnessed evidentiality is realized by a bound verbal suffix (-pnẽ/psira). This article draws upon original fieldwork to offer a detailed description and analysis of -pnẽ/psira. I argue that using -pnẽ/psira presupposes commitment to the proposition p on the part of the speaker. This analysis explains the incompatibility between -pnẽ/psira and clause-typing particles that signal doubt or uncertainty; furthermore, it accounts for how the witnessed on-witnessed contrast projects out of embedded clauses. This article also puts forth an explanation for the historical origin of -pnẽ/psira. A separate suffix, resultative -psẽ/pnẽ/psira, is partially homophonous with the evidential but differs from it on several diagnostics. I propose that resultative constructions in the perfect aspect ('the snake is in the state of having died') were reinterpreted as non-firsthand statements in the past tense ('the snake died [non-witnessed]').",0

When this marker is merged with an adjective in the positive degree, it creates a situation of feature recursion or overlap, where 'more' duplicates certain features that are also present in the adjective that it modifies. We argue that such overlap must be disallowed as a matter of principle. We present an empirical argument in favour of such a restriction, which is based on the generalisation that comparative markers which occur to the left of the adjectival root are incompatible with suppletion. This generalisation can be shown to follow from a restriction against overlapping derivations. In order to achieve such nonoverlapping derivations, an Unmerge operation may remove previously created structure.",0

"Classic theories of the computation of morphological case (Chomsky 2000, 2001, a.o.) argued that a nominal may only receive case once. Several recent accounts (Baker & Vinokurova 2010, Richards 2013, Pesetsky 2014, Levin 2017) proposed instead that case assignment may apply to a single nominal more than once. In this paper, I argue that case-stacking in Amis is overt realization of multiple case assignment. Moreover, movement of a nominal out of the domain of the local phase is not a necessary prerequisite for multiple case assignment (contra Baker & Vinokurova 2010, Levin 2017).",0
"The narrow goal is to provide a complete account of the doubl-ing effect (Ross 1972) within a Minimalist and Distributed Morphology approach. In particular, I examine the effect within nominals and show that the pattern can be fully captured via the interaction of previous analyses: structural differences based on whether the nominals are complex event nominals (Grimshaw 1990), local dislocation of the –ing affix (Punske 2016), and Distinctness (Richards 2010). I show that this account is fully compatible with full facts of the phenomenon and discuss other possible dissimilation effects that may be explored in the future.",0
"This contribution identifies a clue that might lead us towards a better understanding of how the weight of natural and cultural factors is distributed in the design of human languages. First, I propose a specific model of the relationship between lexicon and syntax in human language. This model allows us to use the strategy of correlating the general question of what is natural and what is cultural in language with the nature of the various components that make up a language. Thus, I propose the following correlation: the cultural dimension of language would be expressed essentially in the lexical component of languages, while the biological atural dimension is expressed in the syntactic component. Such a strategy also makes it possible to better understand why different traditions in contemporary linguistic theory arrive at such different assessments of the role of natural factors in language design.",0
"This paper focuses on the issue of 'prosodic idiosyncrasies' as it arises in the Bantu language Makonde [kde]. Recently, Bennett, Harizanov, & Henderson (2018) proposed 'prosodic smothering', whereby prosodic requirements of an outer morpheme override (i.e. 'smother') prosodic properties of inner morphemes. We extend their analysis to phrase-level phonology in Makonde. Previous description has established that whether a nominal modifier forms a single phonological phrase φ with the noun is an idiosyncratic property, e.g. a [NOUN ADJECTIVE] phrase maps to 2 phonological phrases φ(N) φ(ADJ) while a [NOUN DEMONSTRATIVE] phrase forms a single phonological phrase φ(N DEM). Prosodic smothering is seen in [NOUN ADJ DEM] sequences which form a single φ(N ADJ DEM) phonological phrase, where the ADJ has been 'entrapped' and its prosody 'smothered'. We highlight three contributions which Makonde makes to understanding smothering: (i) smothering targets the lexical head, (ii) smothering is both inward-oriented (a morphological relation) and leftward-oriented (a linear relation), and (iii) a limited amount of outward smothering is parasitic on the presence of inward smothering. From the smothering facts in Makonde, we conclude that prosody is established at two stages: first, prosodic idiosyncrasies apply at spell-out (i.e. the mapping from syntax to phonology), followed by default prosodification which is established within the phonological module itself.",0
"In a number of cases, suppletion (or suppletive or contextual allomorphy) can
be seen to involve, not competition between two forms for a given position, but instead two structures that differ (a bit) in size and that also differ in that one contains a silent element lacking in the other. If so, then the substitution intuition that underlies much work on suppletion and contextual allomorphy must be wrong, in at least some nonnegligeable set of cases.",0
"German particle verbs consist of a base and a particle, two constituents which occupy separate positions in main clauses, but share one lexical entry. It is still unclear if the combination of particles and bases during sentence comprehension is lexical, syntactic or dual in nature. Using behavioural and ERP measurements, we investigated lexical access and sentence integration of split particle verbs in German two-argument sentences. Our results show that the integration of split particle verbs violating sentence structure or lexical constraints leads to both lexical and syntactic processing diffculty. This extends earlier comparable ndings reporting only lexical access diffculties, and suggests that the parse is not immediately abandoned upon encountering a nonexistent particle verb. The integration of grammatical particle verbs assigning lexical case did not lead to measurable processing diffculties. We discuss the impact of this finding for current accounts of the role of lexical case marking in sentence comprehension.",0
"There are few studies which have focused on the pronunciation of vowels with secondary stress in English. Within the framework introduced by Guierre (1979), this paper offers a large empirical study of these vowels and focuses on three key categories of words: non-derived words, constructions containing a semantically transparent prefix and suffixal derivatives. Overall, previous analyses based on rank, phonological domains and derivational isomorphism are confirmed but certain phenomena unveiled by this study require a few revisions of existing models. Several possible formalisation options are proposed to implement these revisions. The most promising seems to be the (here, exploratory) analysis using feet because it could considerably broaden the empirical coverage of the theory.",0
"This paper investigates how structure emerges in a young language, focusing on compounding in two young sign languages, Israeli Sign Language (ISL) and Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL). We focus on novel compounds (tokens invented on the spot) to ensure that we are studying a productive process and to avoid issues contingent with lexicalization. We found that both languages make use both of compounding and size-and-shape classifier constructions (SASS-constructions), but ISL and ABSL have conventionalized different structures and the structures they do use are conventionalized to different degrees. We discuss the similarities and differences of those constructions in ISL and ABSL in the context of structure emergence and language evolution.",0
"This paper proposes a new generalisation concerning the morphosyntactic marking of grammatical dependencies. Important typological work by Nichols (1986) distinguished marking the head of a grammatical relationship (head-marking) from marking of the dependent (dependent-marking). In addition, the relationship between co-heads in an extended projection may also be marked. To these three forms of marking this paper adds a further parameter: the distinction between affixes and independent syntactic words as markers of the relevant relationship. Exploring this parameter leads to a more restrictive theory of marking grammatical dependencies, whereby of the three forms of marking, only dependent-marking is available for independent syntactic words. It is argued that this restriction can be derived from three assumptions: (i) independent syntactic words head a projection in their own right in the syntax; affixes do not; (ii) if the marker of a grammatical relationship heads its own functional projection, it is subject to a structural intervention requirement; (iii) principles of Extended Projection (Grimshaw 2000, 2005). The empirical means of testing the theory is provided by linkers – syntactically independent, semantically vacuous words indicating a relationship between two items. Using data from genetically and geographically diverse languages, it is shown firstly that linkers may be used to mark a variety of head-dependent relationships, but never the relationship between co-heads in an extended projection, and secondly that the linker always marks the dependent: constituency tests from fronting, coordination and deletion, as well as independent morphosyntactic properties, indicate that the linker is invariably attached to the dependent.",0
"Research has so far assumed that the German secret languages, sociolects, and dealer languages do not have any independent grammatical structures. Taking the morpho-syntactic structure of numerals as an example, this article shows that grammatical patterns of the donor languages (Romani, Yiddish, Hebrew) that clearly differ from German can also become productive in those languages.",0
"Over the past 15 years there has been an explosion in the number of languages reported to allow indexical shift. Across this literature, the argument for indexical shifting is typically quite simple:
  (Premise 1) Indexical n has non-utterance-based reference in embedded clause c of language L.
(Premise 2) Clause c cannot be a quote (e.g. because it is permeable to wh-movement or NPI licensing, or contains descriptions de re).
(Conclusion) Therefore, Language L allows indexical shift.

Is this form of argument valid? For many cases discussed in the recent literature: only if we take 1st/2nd person agreement to always indicate that the agreement controller is actually an indexical. But there is reason to doubt that premise, both from the theoretical literature (Anand 2006) and the typological/descriptive literature (Culy 1994, Curnow 2002).  Elements that may control what is canonically 1st person agreement include not only 1st person indexicals but also a class of elements I will call indexiphors (sometimes also called 'first person logophors').  An indexiphor is like a logophor and unlike an indexical in that it must be bound by an OP-log in the left periphery of an embedded clause; it is like an indexical in the agreement that it controls.

In this paper, I argue (following Anand 2006) that indexiphors and true shifted indexicals are both possible in natural language, with distinct empirical profiles. (E.g. indexicals but not indexiphors obey Shift Together; indexiphors but not indexicals obey De Re Blocking.) Unknotting the two takes us a significant distance toward a constrained typology of indexical shift and ""shifty agreement"" crosslinguistically.

Languages discussed include Amharic and Mishar Tatar.",0
"Traditional theories of phonological variation propose that morphemes be encoded with descriptors such as [+/- Rule X], to capture which of them participate in a variable process. More recent theories predict that morphemes can have LEXICAL PROPENSITIES: idiosyncratic, gradient rates at which they participate in a process-e.g., [0.7 Rule X]. This dissertation argues that such propensities exist, and that a binary distinction is not rich enough to characterize participation in variable processes. Corpus investigations into Slovenian palatalization and French liaison reveal that individual morphemes pattern across an entire propensity spectrum, and that encoding individual morphemes with gradient status improves model performance. Furthermore, an experimental investigation into French speakers' intuitions suggests that they internalize word-specific propensities to undergo liaison. The dissertation turns to modeling language learners' ability to acquire the idiosyncratic behavior of individual attested morphemes while frequency matching to statistical generalizations across the lexicon. A recent model based in Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar (MaxEnt) makes use of general constraints that putatively capture statistical generalizations across the lexicon, as well as lexical constraints governing the behavior of individual words. A series of learning simulations reveals that the approach fails to learn statistical generalizations across the lexicon: lexical constraints are so powerful that the learner comes to acquire the behavior of each attested form using only these constraints, at which point the general constraint is rendered ineffective. A GENERALITY BIAS is therefore attributed to learners, whereby they privilege general constraints over lexical ones. It is argued that MaxEnt fails to represent this property in its current formulation, and that it be replaced with the hierarchical MIXED-EFFECTS LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL (MIXED-EFFECTS MAXENT), which is shown to succeed in learning both a frequency-matching grammar and lexical propensities, by encoding general constraints as fixed effects and lexical constraints as a random effect. The learner treats the grammar and lexicon differently, in that vocabulary effects are subordinated to broad, grammatical effects in the learning process.

"This paper investigates first person plurals in Ch'ol, a Mayan language of southern Mexico. The Ch'ol person paradigm reveals that the exclusive plural form ""oñ=laj-oñ"" is derived by adding ""-oñ"", the first person form, to the inclusive form ""oñ=la"". Based on empirical generalizations from the usage of the two first person plural forms, I recategorize the inclusive as a general first person plural and the exclusive as a specified exclusive form that explicitly excludes the hearer. I provide data showing that the exclusive form is both morphologically and semantically more complex. I formalize the person paradigm in Ch'ol with binary features (e.g. Noyer 1992, Bobaljik 2008, Watanabe 2013). I argue that a binary feature approach with a [±hearer] feature can better capture the Ch'ol data as it can explicitly exclude the hearer from the representation. I argue that the Ch'ol data poses challenges for privative feature approaches, like feature geometries (e.g. Harley & Ritter 2002, Cowper & Hall 2005) as these privative systems do not have a way to explicitly exclude a [hearer] feature.",0
"Using data from two empirical studies, the present article investigates whether German adjective-noun compounds are inherently more appropriate to function as naming units or kind terms than the corresponding phrases. In the first experiment, it was tested whether subjects prefer a non-lexicalized compound (e.g., Kurzcouch, short_couch) or the respective non-lexicalized phrasal counterpart (e.g., kurze Couch, short couch) in order to express a novel complex lexical concept (e.g., It is a very specific couch that is 1.30 meters short because it is designed only for children up to this size.). In the second
test, subjects rated on a scale how well the compounds and phrases expressed the newly created concepts. The findings of the two studies support the idea that compounds are better naming candidates than phrases. It is claimed that the effect derives from the specific formal nature of compounds and has consequences on the processing and mental representation of the two construction types.",1
"Nonlocal phonological interactions are often sensitive to morphological domains. Bolivian Aymara restricts the cooccurrence of plain, ejective, and aspirated stops within, but not across, morphemes. We document these restrictions in a morphologically parsed corpus of Aymara. We further present two experiments with native Aymara speakers. In the first experiment, speakers are asked to repeat nonce words that should be interpreted as monomorphemic. Speakers are more accurate at repeating nonce words that respect the nonlocal phonotactic restrictions than nonce words that violate them. In a second experiment, some nonce words are interpetable as morphologically complex, while others suggest a monomorphemic parse. Speakers show a sensitivity to this difference, and repeat the words more accurately when they can be interpreted as having a morpheme boundary between two consonants that tend to not cooccur inside a morpheme. Finally, we develop a computational model that induces nonlocal representations from the baseline grammar. The model posits projections when it notices that certain segments often cooccur when separated by a morpheme boundary. The model generates a full Maximum Entropy phonotactic grammar, which makes distinctions between attested and rare/unattested sequences in a way that aligns with the speaker behavior.",0
"On a general level, this paper is concerned by the categorisation of expressions in natural languages. We approach this question with a relatively new tool in hand: phrasal spell-out. The basic idea is this: if phrasal spell-out exists, a single item may correspond to several terminals, where each terminal has a distinct label. As a consequence, the approach predicts the existence of expressions whose behaviour corresponds to a mixture of prototypical categorial properties.

This paper applies this relatively new analytical option to locative markers in Shona and Luganda. These markers are notorious for exhibiting behaviour that is hard to capture by traditional means, and have been used as evidence against the universal status of the category P.",0
"The current paper explores the pronominal system in Standard Arabic (SA) within the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz, 1993, 1994; Halle, 1997; and Embick & Noyer, 2006). Although the pronominal system in SA includes pronouns declining for person, gender, number and case, morphological syncretism exists where gender is not contrastive in the 1st person pronouns plus the dual pronouns. Moreover, case does not show distinct realizations in the accusative/genitive pronouns. The paper shows that the under-specification of vocabulary items can account for all the pronominal patterns. However, two syntax-independent mechanisms are needed to account for problematic bimorphemic pronouns: Fission (Noyer, 1997) and Impoverishment (Bonet, 1991). In this paper, fission is proposed in a rule-governed format, where a node is split into two nodes: the first node bears the case/person features while the other bears the number/gender features. As for the syncretism in the case of the 3rd person pronouns and in the gender of the dual pronouns, they are accounted for by two contextualized impoverishment rules: the first rule involves the deletion of case features, whereas the other deletes the gender features. Both impoverishment rules are operative in the 3rd person dual pronouns and they occur in a non-restrictive order.",0
"This paper argues for the existence direct clausal DP-shells – structures in which an embedded CP is directly dominated by a projection of D. While this structure has been proposed in previous literature, it poses a theoretical problem for the well-formedness of extended projections (Grimshaw, 1991, 2000), in which a D head must appear in the extended projection of a noun. A careful investigation of embedded clauses in Ndebele (verb-complement, noun-complement and relative clauses) points to the conclusion that the grammar must allow base generation of direct clausal DP shells.",0
"Terminological issues aside, there is near-universal agreement among linguists that the lexicon is a messy and ugly place. A place of disorder, exceptions and cacophony. This contribution is a short outline of why this consensus may prove to be wrong. More precisely, why it is vacuous on one reading, and probably wrong on the other. As an alternative, I will outline an approach with a clean, principled and restrictive lexicon, whose core is: The (morpho)syntactic lexicon contains nothing but well formed (morpho)syntactic expressions.",0
"In this paper we present new data on a subject / non-subject extraction asymmetry in Igbo constituent questions. We provide evidence that the superficially morphological phenomenon reflects a deeper syntactic asymmetry: unlike wh-non-subjects, wh-subjects cannot undergo local A'-movement to the left periphery (SpecFoc); rather, they have to stay in their canonical position SpecT. The same constraint also leads to the that-trace effect in the embedded clause of long subject wh-movement. We argue that what is responsible for the special status of wh-subjects is their high structural position. We provide an optimality-theoretic analysis of the asymmetry that is based on anti-locality: local subject A'-movement is excluded because it is too short. Moreover, we address the nature of apparent wh-in-situ and repair by resumption in Igbo.",0
"The non-possessive uses of possessive morphology in Uralic languages have been a topic of intense debate (Fraurud 2001; Nikolaeva 2003; Gerland 2014; Janda 2015; É. Kiss and Tánczos to appear). In this paper, I focus on a special use of the poss.3sg suffix in Hungarian constructions such as a hülyéje (the stupid-poss.3sg): lit. 'its stupid', meaning 'that total idiot'. My main claim is that this suffix is an affective demonstrative suffix (Lakoff 1974; Liberman 2008; Potts and Schwarz 2010), and that it has developed as a result of grammaticalization from a full-fledged possessive construction of the form a világ hülyéje (the world stupid-poss.3sg): lit. 'the world's stupid', meaning: 'the biggest idiot in the world'. I will show that this gradual process can be reconstructed fairly accurately using historical and contemporary corpora. I also claim that this grammaticalization pathway is very natural as it is based on a set-element relationship which is often expressed by possessive constructions cross-linguistically. I also identify two parameters which facilitate this grammaticalization process: the availability of (silent) pro possessors and the lack of gender agreement on the possessive suffix. Since Uralic languages in general have these parameters, I will argue that this grammaticalization pathway should at least be considered as one of the possible sources of the demonstrative (and definiteness marking) uses of poss.3sg suffixes in Uralic languages. Finally, my results are also an important contribution to the debate on whether demonstratives can be derived from other functional elements through grammaticalization (Plank 1979; Traugott 1982; Himmelmann 1997).",1
"In this paper, we hope to disambiguate the nature of look-alike intervening elements that appear between verbs in Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) and Serial Verb Construction Nominalizations (SVCNs). To do so, we will first show that these intervening elements share the same phonological form. We will then show that although the intervening elements look the same on the surface, they can be differentiated by appealing to semantics and the construction from which the SVCN is derived. In doing so, we find that some of the intervening elements should, indeed, be regarded as tamp markers, while others are nominalizing markers (NMLZ). In conclusion, we identify abstract schemata/templates that account for, and predict the positioning of, intervening elements found in Akan SVCNs.",0
"The paper provides evidence for a more articulated structure of the comparative as compared with the one in Bobaljik (2012). We propose to split up Bobaljik's CMPR head into two distinct heads, C1 and C2. Looking at Czech, Old Church Slavonic and English, we show that this proposal explains a range of facts about suppletion and allomorphy. A crucial ingredient of our analysis is the claim that adjectival roots are not a-categorial, but spell out adjectival functional structure. Specifically, we argue that adjectival roots come in various types, differing in the amount of functional structure they spell out. In order to correctly model the competition between roots, we further introduce a Faithfulness Restriction on Cyclic Override, which allows us to dispense with the Elsewhere Principle.",0
"Moro (2009) proposes that Italian inversion structures provide evidence for one of the predictions of the Labeling algorithm (LA, Chomsky 2013, 2015). This is that in structures in which labeling is ambiguous, one of the constituents must be moved to a higher position, instantiated in Italian inversion as an intermediate focus position. However, Italian provides little independent evidence for movement to such a position and the evidence it does provide is limited to symmetrical structures containing two DPs. In this paper, I argue that Kirundi Object-Verb-Subject (OVS) inversion structures and transitive expletive constructions (TECs) (Ura 1996, Ndayiragije 1999), provide more direct evidence for the type of movement that Moro proposes for Italian. Because of a confluence of Kirundi idiosyncrasies, Kirundi shows unambiguously that when the external argument does not move to Spec, TP, it cannot stay in Spec, vP. Importantly, this ban on remaining in Spec, vP cannot be accounted for by appealing to relativized minimality (Rizzi 1990). Kirundi thus instantiates a key prediction of the LA.",0
"Sanskrit  /-retroflexion is one of the most complex segmental processes in phonology. While it is still star-free, it does not fit in any of the subregular classes that are commonly entertained in the literature. We show that when construed as a phonotactic dependency, the process fits into a class we call input-output tier-based strictly local (IO-TSL), a natural extension of the familiar class TSL. IO-TSL increases the power of TSL's tier projection function by making it an input-output strictly local transduction. Assuming that  /-retroflexion represents the upper bound on the complexity of segmental phonology, this shows that all of segmental phonology can be captured by combining the intuitive notion of tiers with the independently motivated machinery of strictly local mappings.",1
"Taking its cue from sign languages, this paper proposes that the recruitment and composition of body actions provide evidence for key properties of language and its emergence.  Adopting the view that compositionality is the fundamental organizing property of language, we show first that actions of the hands, face, head, and torso in sign languages directly reflect linguistic components, and illuminate certain aspects of compositional organization among them that are relevant for all languages, signed and spoken.  Studies of emerging sign languages strengthen the approach by showing that the gradual recruitment of bodily articulators for linguistic functions directly maps the way in which a new language increases in complexity and efficiency over time.  While compositional communication is almost exclusively restricted to humans, it is not restricted to language.  In the spontaneous, intense emotional displays of athletes, different emotional states are correlated with actions of particular face and body features and feature groupings.  These findings indicate a much more ancient communicative compositional capacity, and support a paradigm that includes visible body actions in the quest for core linguistic properties and their origins.",1
"Definiteness has been a central topic in theoretical semantics since its modern foundation. However, despite its significance, there has been surprisingly scarce research on its cross-linguistic expression. With the purpose of contributing to filling this gap, the present volume gathers thirteen studies exploiting insights from formal semantics and syntax, typological and language specific studies, and, crucially, semantic fieldwork and cross-linguistic semantics, in order to address the expression and interpretation of definiteness in a diverse group of languages, most of them understudied.

            The papers presented in this volume aim to establish a dialogue between theory and data in order to answer the following questions:  What formal strategies do natural languages employ to encode definiteness? What are the possible meanings associated to this notion across languages? Are there different types of definite reference? Which other functions (besides marking definite reference) are associated with definite descriptions? Each of the papers contained in this volume addresses at least one of these questions and, in doing so, they aim to enrich our understanding of definiteness.",0
"On the basic of the assumption that linguistic diversity and biodiversity are correlated, many a few studies have been done. For example, significance of the relationship between language and species richness through different area-specific parameters has been demonstrated. This demonstration also reveals that there is a  similar kind of relationship between linguistic varieties and forest area cover of the Indian states. Result shows a strong positive correlation between these two variables.",0
"If elements move to satisfy the needs of a probe, as in a theory of attraction, why can more than one element move? Looking at clitic pronouns, we advance a view of this probe generosity motivated by the same economy considerations underlying the Principle of Minimal Compliance (Richards 1997, 1998): once the probe has its needs satisfied by the highest goal, as locality requires, it is free to interact with other goals just in case they would not have done a better job of satisfying those needs. This accounts for a particularly rich system of pronominal cliticization in several Sierra Zapotec languages (Oto-Manguean: Oaxaca), in which movement is restricted both by the Person–Case Constraint (PCC; Perlmutter 1971, Bonet 1991) and by hierarchy-sensitive constraints based on gender. It allows also for a principled understanding of the attested crosslinguistic variation in what might be called, more generally, Phi–Case Constraints (ΦCCs). These form a tightly constrained typology, whose highly asymmetrical shape derives from the cyclic probing enabled by economy-driven probe generosity.",0
"This paper discusses cases where non-adjacent cells in morphological paradigms are syncretic, commonly called ABA patterns (Bobaljik 2012 et seqq.). Data from verbs in Germanic languages are examined, as earlier work  suggests that a *ABA constraint may be active in this domain. It will be shown that there are verbs in several Germanic languages which exhibit genuine ABA patterns, precluding an analysis based on a constraint *ABA. It is suggested that the rarity of ABA patterns should instead be given a diachronic explanation in terms of Proto-Germanic conjugation classes. This approach is independently motivated by frequency asymmetries in modern Germanic languages, and correctly predicts where ABA patterns are more likely to appear. The research reported here adds to a rapidly-growing body of work on extralinguistic explanations for linguistic patterns (Anderson 2016), suggesting a severely reduced explanatory role for formal linguistic constraints.",0
"In Xining Chinese, especially as used by older people, free nouns are always reduplicated, as a purely formal condition without any semantic effects. We argue that the reduplication takes place when a categoryless root is merged with a null nominal categorizer which copies the phonological matrix of the root. There is a condition on word formation, maybe universal but certainly applying to Chinese, that a content word must consist of at least two constituents. A root merged with a categorizer satisfies this condition. In Xining Chinese the condition on nouns is that they have to consist of minimally two pronounced constituents. When the condition is not independently satisfied, as in a compound or affixed noun, reduplication is how the condition is met. In conjunction with a minimalist theory of word formation, this will be shown to predict the distribution of reduplication in various contexts. For instance, the head of a compound can be reduplicated, but not the modifier, some affixes but not others permit reduplication of the base, non-compositional compounds do not allow any reduplication, and so called 'bound roots' (really, bound words) are not reduplicated. The phenomenon provides very strong evidence that simple content words are made up of categoryless root and a categorizer which is often null, but can be overt in some languages, including Xining Chinese.",1
"I argue that verb movement should be derived in narrow syntax. The derivational system of Labeling Algorithm proposed by Chomsky (2013, 2015) allows movement to occur in narrow syntax without recourse to any movement-triggering features, contra Chomsky (2001, 2004, 2008). In this system, (both external and internal) Merge is free, even if a new semantic effect does not occur on a raised category in its raised position, contra Chomsky (2001). Thus, verb movement, which does not change a semantic interpretation in the unmarked case, should be able to occur in narrow syntax without recourse to any driving features. As we see in the Icelandic data, it is actually difficult to claim that verb movement occurs in phonology, contra Chomsky (2001). I propose a way to carry out verb movement in narrow syntax in terms of feature inheritance and copy deletion. In the Romance languages as well as languages such as English, both φ-features and tense are inherited by T, to which R(=V)+v* moves, whereas in the V2 languages, only φ-features are inherited by T with tense remaining in C, to which R+v* directly moves. In all of those languages, it is a matter of morphophonology which copy of a verbal head, the one in a higher position or the one in the v* head position, is chosen to be pronounced. I also claim that do is inserted in English to phonetically embody features such as [Q], [Foc(us)] and [Pol(arity)]. The feature that the inserted do embodies is adjacent to tense and -features in each of the relevant constructions, which accounts for why the inserted do carries tense and agreement as pointed out by the traditional literature.",0
"The sign language phenomenon that some scholars refer to as ""agreement"" has triggered controversial discussions among sign language linguists. Crucially, it has been argued to display properties that are at odds with the notion of agreement in spoken languages. A thorough theoretical investigation of the phenomenon may thus add to our understanding of the nature and limits of agreement in natural language. Previous analyses of the phenomenon can be divided into three groups: (i) gesture-based non-syntactic analyses, (ii) hybrid solutions combining syntactic and semantic agreement, and (iii) syntactic accounts under which agreement markers are reanalyzed as clitics. As opposed to these accounts, we argue in this paper that sign language agreement does represent an instance of agreement proper, as familiar from spoken language, that is fully governed by syntactic principles. We propose an explicit formal analysis couched within the Minimalist Program that is modality-independent and only involves mechanisms that have been independently proposed for the analysis of agreement in spoken language. Our proposal is able to capture the (apparent) peculiarities of sign language agreement such as the distinction of verb types (only some verbs show agreement), the behavior of backwards verbs (verbs displaying agreement reversal), and the distribution of the agreement auxiliary. However, we suggest that the combination of mechanisms is modality-specific, that is, agreement in sign language, and in German Sign Language in particular, involves modality-independent ingredients, but uses a modality-specific recipe which calls for a (somewhat) unusual combination of independently motivated mechanisms.",1
"The contrast between the Russian čto and the Polish co 'what' is syntactic
and reflects the way in which an identical sequence of features in the syntactic
representation becomes realized as morphology. Specifically, I argue that this
scenario follows from a spell-out mechanism outlined in Starke (2018), where
prefix formation, as in the Russian tri-morphemic č-t-o but not in the Polish
bi-morphemic c-o, takes place in order to spell out a feature which cannot be
spelled out in the mainline derivation. Next, I explore a possibility that the
wh-prefix in kto 'who', the same form in Russian and Polish, merges with a
syntactically different stem than the one present in the lexical items for 'what',
a scenario more transparently visible on the example of the English wh-at and wh-o.",0
"This paper proposes a diachronic account of loan-verb integration strategies in Coptic. We
argue that the synchronic variation found in the diverse Coptic dialects reflects a gradual
change from one integration strategy to another. This change proceeds from the original
'light verb' construction to the 'direct insertion' construction, with a number of dialects

In this dissertation, I investigate the sensitivity of φ-agreement to features typically associated with Ā-extraction, including those related to wh-questioning, relativization, focus and topicalization. This phenomenon has been referred to as anti-agreement (Ouhalla 1993) or wh-agreement (Chung and Georgopoulos 1988; Georgopoulos 1991; Chung 1994) in the literature. While anti-agreement is commonly held to result from constraints on the Ā-movement of agreeing DPs, I argue that it reduces to an instance of wh-agreement, or the appearance of particular morphological forms in the presence of Ā-features. I develop a unified account of these Ā-sensitive φ-agreement effects in which they arise from the ability of φ-probes to copy both φ-features and Ā-features in the syntax, coupled with postsyntactic morphological operations that manipulate feature bundles containing both [φ] and [Ā]. Thus, the link between anti-agreement and Ā-movement is illusory. Because Ā-movement is derived by the presence of certain Ā-features on the moving DP, anti-agreement will most often coincide with Ā-movement. But there are places where this correlation comes apart. All that is necessary for the emergence of anti-agreement is the presence of an Ā-feature on a DP that controls φ-agreement. The empirical foundation of the work is a typological survey of Ā-sensitive φ-agreement effects in 63 genetically and geographically diverse languages. This study is the largest of its kind to examine these effects, and brings to light new generalizations both about the syntax of Ā-sensitive φ-agreement effects and the behavior of φ-features in the presence of Ā-features.",0
"This paper shows that inverse marking and portmanteau agreement are in complementary distribution in Algonquin: inverse marking is possible only in contexts where portmanteau agreement is not. This correlation holds despite intralanguage variation in both phenomena. The paper proposes that the two phenomena pattern together because both are determined by the outcome of the Agree operation on Infl. When Infl enters a Multiple Agree relation with both arguments, the realization of portmanteau agreement morphology is possible. When Infl agrees only with the object, it duplicates the result of an earlier object agreement operation on Voice. The presence of identical features on Infl and Voice triggers an impoverishment operation that deletes the features of Voice, resulting in its spellout as an underspecified elsewhere form-which is the exponent that we know descriptively as the inverse marker. This analysis explains why inverse marking and portmanteau agreement never co-occur in Algonquin: the two phenomena are determined by alternative outcomes of the Agree operation on Infl.  The analysis also enables a simple account of the intralanguage variation in the patterning of the two phenomena, which is shown to follow from variation in the specification of the probe on Infl.",1
"This dissertation investigates two case-related phenomena: aspect-conditioned differential subject case marking and overt case-stacking, and why case morphology on a DP may correlate with movement of a DP.

Guided by data from Amis (Formosan, Austronesian), I argue that case assignment may apply to a single DP more than once and case-stacking is overt realisation of multiple case assignment. In Amis, a DP surfaces with all the cases it has been assigned when it is a contrastive topic. Moreover, Amis provides strong evidence for treating case-stacking truly as stacking of multiple cases, instead of stacking a focus marker over a case marker.

In addition, I propose that case morphology and whether a DP can undergo certain type of movement are both mediated by 𝜙-agreement. Specifically, each successful 𝜙-agreement with a DP introduces to the DP a K(ase), a structural correlate of morphological case. This is based on the behavior of subjects of perfective clauses. I posit that in Amis, perfective subjects, as opposed to imperfective subjects, are 𝜙-defective. This is manifested in one fewer instance of case assignment and inability to undergo certain type of movement.",0
"This paper provides support for a modified DM model which I call Optimality Theoretic Distributed Morphology (OT-DM). The strongest form of this model is that all morphological operations take place in parallel, which I call the Morphology-in-Parallel Hypothesis (MPH). Although combining OT and DM is unorthodox in practice, I show that a growing body of data warrants his modification (Trommer 2001a, 2001b, 2002; Dawson in press; Foley to appear; a.o.), and provide evidence for OT-DM from a morphological conspiracy involving verbal clitics in Degema (Nigeria). To account for this conspiracy, I argue that agreement clitics are inserted post-syntactically via the DM operation Dissociated Node Insertion (DNI), and further that verb complexes are formed post-syntactically via the operation Local Dislocation (LD). I argue that both these operations are triggered by a well-formedness markedness constraint which requires verbs to appear in properly inflected words on the surface. These DM operations are decomposed into a series of constraints which are crucially ranked. Candidates are freely generated from GEN and are subject to all DM operations, and are evaluated via EVAL against the ranked constraint set. I illustrate that under standard views of DM in which DNI proceeds VI, a serial model results in an ordering paradox, and that even after parameterizing DM operation ordering in response, this model does not adequately account for the morphological conspiracy.

"This book provides an in-depth account of the morphosyntax of case and agreement in Panará, a language of the Jê family. Panará is spoken by 500-600 people currently living in four villages in the Panará Indigenous Land, located between the states of Mato Grosso and Pará, in central Brazil.

On the one hand, Panará presents some typically Jê traits: the lexical correspondences, phonemic inventories, phonological processes and general morphological profile all have the characteristics that one would expect in any Jê language. On the other hand, the constituent order, case marking patterns and verbal morphology are radically different from what we find elsewhere in the Jê family. The present dissertation contains a thorough description of the phenomena at hand, as well as a discussion of their place in current linguistic theory.",0

"We examine clitic clusters in several Zapotec varieties (Oto-Manguean: Oaxaca), which have some familiar restrictions. First, they exhibit Gender–Case Constraints (GCCs): certain combinations of third-person subject and object clitics are not permitted depending on their position on a four-way gender hierarchy. Second, these Zapotec varieties do not allow certain combinations of identical third-person clitics, which we will call a *X–X Constraint. The repairs for these constraints fail to conform to the predictions the Division of Labor, according to which the violation of a morphological constraint can only be repaired through a morphological operation and, conversely, the violation of a syntactic constraint through syntactic means. (Rezac 2011, Nevins 2011). For both GCCs and the *X–X Constraint, the repair is periphrasis: a strong pronoun replaces the object clitic. Yet, the *X–X Constraint clearly has a morphological source.",0
"Cover text:
Pomeranian is the West Germanic language spoken by European emigrants who went from Farther Pomerania (present-day Poland) to Brazil in the period 1857 - 1887. This language is no longer spoken in cohesive societies in Europe, but the language has survived and is in remarkably good shape on this language island in the tropical state of Espirito Santo. This monograph offers the first synchronic grammar of this language. After a historical introduction, the book offers a systematic description of its phonology, morphology, and syntax. The language is contrasted with its European sisters, more particularly High German, Dutch, and Frisian. It highlights various phenomena that will presumably contribute to the ongoing theoretical debate on the Germanic verbal system. It provides new data on cluster V2, do-support, and the two infinitives. As to the infinitival syntax, the language shows remarkable parallels to the system of Frisian. As to the rich Pomeranian system of subtractive morphology, the phonological account that is offered, will be important for the ongoing discussion of the abstractness of phonological representations. Finally, Pomeranian is a welcome addition to the set of languages on which our etymological understanding of West Germanic is based.",0
"This paper offers an in-depth analysis of the Russian OVS construction in an attempt to account for the parametric variation in the availability of OVS cross-linguistically. It is argued that the Russian OVS construction is base-generated and is employed in order to encode the relative information-structural prominence of arguments. It is proposed that, cross-linguistically, syntactic encoding of information- structural prominence relations via neutral scrambling is available exclusively to languages that are capable of encoding thematic prominence relations of arguments at PF. Conversely, languages that lack PF encoding of thematic prominence are obliged to syntactically represent this prominence relation, which results in the unavailability of syntactic encoding of information-structural prominence. A consequence of this is that when information-structural and thematic prominence relations misalign, only one of them can be syntactically represented. An interpretive relation that fails to be syntactically encoded must be made visible at PF.",0
"Response to ""Generative linguistics and neural networks at 60: foundation, friction, and fusion"" by Joe Pater.

From my perspective, Pater's (2018) target article does a great service to both researchers who work in generative linguistics and researchers who utilize neural networks – and especially to researchers who might find themselves wanting to do both by harnessing the insights of each tradition. The fusion of theories of linguistic representation and probabilistic learning techniques has certainly led to many interesting and valuable insights about the nature of both linguistic representation and the language acquisition process. However, I feel that the most exciting aspect of Pater's article is the increasing interpretability of neural network models, especially when combined with insights from the generative linguistics theoretical framework. This allows for the possibility that neural networks could be used to actually generate new theories of representation. I describe how I think this theory generation process might work with interpretable neural networks.",0

"The surface realization of a linguistic expression can often be predicted from the form of paradigmatically related items that are not contained within it: in Latin, the nominative singular of a noun can often be inferred from the genitive; in French, the final consonant of a prenominal masculine adjective in liaison can typically be predicted from the feminine; in Romanian, the plural form of a noun determines whether its stem will exhibit palatalization before the derivational suffix /-ist/. Such instances of phonological paradigmatic dependence without containment have been claimed to challenge cyclic models of the morphosyntax-phonology interface. In this article, however, they are shown to be established indirectly through the acquisition of underlying representations. This approach correctly predicts that phonological paradigmatic dependencies are never systematically extended to new items if they involve suppletive allomorphy rather than regular alternation, whilst those surface phonological properties of derivatives that are under strict phonotactic control evade paradigmatic dependence on the inflectional forms of their bases. Theories relying on surface-to-surface computation fail to recover these empirical predictions because they are inherently nonmodular, positing generalizations that promiscuously mix phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical information. Underlying representations, therefore, remain indispensable as a means of establishing a necessary modular demarcation between regular phonology and suppletive allomorphy.",0
"In this paper we describe the process of backness harmony in Uyghur, where suffix forms are determined first from the backness of certain vowels in the stem, or, if no such vowels are present, from the backness of dorsals in the stem. We show that this pattern cannot be captured by a tier-based strictly local (TSL) language. This is problematic for the weak subregular hypothesis, which claims that all segmental phonological stringsets are TSL languages. Next, we consider an alternative phonological analysis that is compatible with a TSL representation, but empirically unsupported. Finally, we consider the possibility that Uyghur backness harmony might be a lexicalized pattern, and find some suggestive evidence in support of this. This alternative appears to be the most likely way in which Uyghur backness harmony might, in principle, turn out to be compatible with the hypothesis that TSL languages provide an upper bound on phonological learnability.",0
"Morphosyntactic alignment in the Algonquian languages and some Austronesian languages, including those of the Philippine group, is complicated by the existence of two distinct transitive constructions: the direct and inverse in Algonquian languages and the patient voice and agent voice in Philippine languages. Two my knowledge, the only existing comparison of these two systems is that of Haude and Zúñiga (2016), who employ Algonquian and Philippine as prototypes in a crosslinguistic survey of voice and inverse patterns. My goal in this paper is somewhat different: I aim to compare the Algonquian and Philippine systems with each other in order to determine the degree to which they are similar or different. In particular, I compare the alignment patterns of Cree (Algonquian) and Kapampangan (Philippine). I argue that the two languages are in fact mirror images with respect to morphosyntactic alignment, showing parallel but opposite behaviour across a range of detailed patterns.",0

"The dissertation deals with Russian morphosyntactic phenomena involving adpositions. Much of it is devoted to a study of the distribution of the so-called pripredložnye 'adprepositional' pronouns in Russian. Their seemingly chaotic distribution proved to be hard to account for. Especially puzzling was the fact that beyond the P-object environments these pronouns, 'n-forms', appear only in the genitive standard DP of the Russian phrasal comparative, in which no preposition appears. 

I propose a uniform analysis of the distribution of n-forms in Russian, which maintains the intuition that they are 'adprepositional', i.e. occur in P-object positions. However, I refine the generalization by saying that n-forms are only licensed in the complement of P-heads. I thus make a crucial distinction between a vaguely defined group of prepositions and lexemes that are syntactically P-heads. Only those 'prepositions' that are P-heads license n-forms in their complement. 


I examine a large group of 'prepositions' in detail, arguing that only some of them are P-heads. The 'comparative puzzle' is solved by proposing that the phrasal comparative in Russian involves a null P-head that licenses the genitive n-form in the standard DP. Lexemes labelled prepositions in traditional grammars of Russian are proposed to split into three classes. Class I lexemes are P-heads, the only 'true' prepositions in a sense. Class II lexemes are structurally ambiguous between N-heads or P-N combinations (the complement being an argument of the nominal head), and a lexicalized P-head composed of syntactically inactive N- and P-elements. Class III lexemes are never P-heads: they are P-N combinations, transitive adverbs (A-heads) or gerunds (V-heads). 


The arguments for treating 'prepositions' of Class III as non-prepositions, and lexemes of Class II as ambiguous between prepositions and nouns or prepositional phrases are theoretically quite neutral and may be adopted to explain n-form distribution in various linguistic frameworks, making this thesis potentially relevant to a wide audience of readers. However, maintaining the same analysis to derive n-forms in the phrasal comparative while avoiding the claim that synthetic comparatives are actually prepositions (P-heads) is more demanding: it requires an abstract theoretical framework that allows syntactically active but phonetically null elements of various categories, here P-heads. The existence of independent evidence for the null P analysis of the phrasal comparative and the explanatory power of the resulting uniform treatment of n-forms justify this abstract construct, suggesting that this kind of approach may well be on the right track. 


This part of the dissertation has implications for the typology and morphosyntax of pronouns, and typology and theory of case. It may also be instructive for further studies aimed at classifying adpositions in various languages. In addition, the classification of 'prepositions' developed here may prove relevant for understanding the non-homogeneous behavior of different prepositions in specific constructions. 


The remaining part of this dissertation delves more deeply into the syntax of the Russian phrasal comparative, the structure behind the genitive standard of comparison. I show that the standard DP and the DP it is contrasted with belong in the same clause. This favors the simple, Direct Analysis of the standard DP, under which it does not involve additional (silent) structure. Next, I offer a new generalization, the Oblique Correlate Constraint, which imposes morphosyntactic restrictions on the genitive standard DP. I show that the constraint quite straightforwardly falls out from a more complex, Reduced Clause Analysis, positing abstract structure behind the standard. Looking at other languages, I suggest that the presence of such a constraint in their phrasal comparative may signal that they are to be analyzed as reduced clauses. This study adds to the growing body of literature on the structure of phrasal comparatives across languages and contributes to the notorious debate on whether standard of comparison in phrasal comparatives is to be analyzed as a simple DP or as a reduced clause.",0
"This paper explores the claim that a particular domain-a phase-can be at least partially spelled out, and then subsequently accessed by heads from a higher phase. I provide morphological evidence for this claim, by looking at various examples in which a morphological (i.e. postsyntactic) process feeds a later narrow syntactic one. Main evidence for this argument comes from the interaction between syntactic head movement and postsyntactic affixation in the Niger-Congo language Wolof, which confirms an important prediction of this analysis. Namely, if a postsyntactic process can feed a syntactic one, we also expect the postsyntactic process to be bled if the structural conditions for its application are not met, resulting in surface opacity effects. This is precisely what we find in Wolof, where the past tense morpheme 'oon' is postsyntactically affixed onto the verb in a particular structural con- figuration and carried along with it to C, but stranded by the verb below C if the structural requirements for its affixation are not met.",0
"When arguments are clitic-doubled, the clitic and the nominal it doubles typically bear the same case feature. However, recent theoretical work on clitic-doubling, including but not limited to so-called 'Big DP' analyses (e.g. Uriagereka 1995, Nevins 2011, Kramer 2014) treats clitics and nominals as separable entities in the syntactic derivation. Given this background, we propose that under the right syntactic conditions, nominals and their clitics should be able to mismatch in case features. In particular, we identify and investigate two classes of mismatch, which form the mirror image of each other. In Choctaw (Muskogean), nominals acquire case features that their associated clitics lack, while in Yimas (Lower-Sepik; data from Foley 1991), clitics acquire case features that their associated nomals lack. We argue that these mismatches are the consequence of case-assignment operations that target nominals or clitics individually.

The availability of such targeted case-assignment operations is contingent on the language creating the right syntactic configurations. In Choctaw, nominals may be individually targeted for a round of NOM/ACC case-assignment because clitics are doubled at a low position on the clausal spine: by the time that NOM/ACC case is assigned at TP, clitics have already separated from their nominal associates. And in Yimas, clitics may be individually targeted for a round of ERG/ABS case-assignment because they adjoin to the same functional head: following Yuan (2017), multiple clitics adjoined to the same head may employ case-assignment as a dissimilation strategy.",0
"This paper focuses on a case of prosodically-driven morpheme non-realization found in Minorcan Catalan kinship restrictive appositional phrases, in which the personal article en is realized before masculine personal names starting with a consonant, but not before masculine personal names starting with a vowel, or before feminine personal names starting in either a vowel or a consonant. From a strictly syllabic point of view, this pattern is unexpected, since a preconsonantal coda is generated in the former cases, and an onset-less syllable and a hiatus are generated in the second. Following work by Selkirk (2001), we propose that this asymmetric behavior is mainly driven by the constraint ALIGN(PWd, L; Lex), according to which the left edge of the prosodic word must be aligned with a lexical category. We show that, whereas it is possible to satisfy this constraint without challenging basic syllabification constraints (i.e. *C.V, ONSET) when the personal name starts with a consonant, this is not possible when the personal name starts with a vowel. The effects of the alignment constraint are inhibited by the need to realize phonologically the morph corresponding to a morpheme when the information it carries is not recoverable, and this explains the realization of the personal article in isolated constructions. The interaction of ALIGN(PWd, L; Lex) with standard right-alignment requirements, finally, accounts for the lack of realization of the feminine personal article before feminine personal names in these appositional phrases. The data taken into consideration and the subsequent formal analysis allow us to explore the nature and the typology of morpheme realization constraints, and to assess the theoretical consequences for the phonology-morphosyntax interface and for the architecture of grammar.",0
"This paper investigates the complex verbal agreement system in Hayu (Kiranti). In most scenarios, the subject and the object of a transitive verb compete for cross-referencing on the verb. The ""winner"" is determined by the interaction of two prominence scales. Interestingly, these scales need to be ranked in order to produce the correct output in cases of conflicting preferences. Moreover, in one particular context, it seems as if the ranking of the scales has to be reversed. This agreement pattern poses a challenge to existing analyses of scale-driven agreement. I propose a Harmonic Grammar-based analysis where an argument's prominence is quantified by a numerical value: the more salient on a prominence scale, the higher the numerical value of an argument. The values of different scales are added to produce the harmony score for each of the arguments. The agreement rule in Hayu then turns out to be very simple: the agreement controller is the argument that has the highest harmony score. In this system, the ""exceptional"" scenario falls out automatically as a cumulative effect; neither complex constraints nor (reversed) scale rankings are necessary.",0
"In this paper, I explore ways of analyzing contextual allomorphy that eschew reference to competition and blocking. Instead, I propose the independence assumption on suffixes.

Lastly, I show how the phenomenon of doublets provides strong support for the independence assumption.",0
"In this paper we provide a novel and unified formal analysis of the stress
microvariation found in verb-enclitic groupings in Barcelona Catalan, with stress stability, in Formentera Catalan, with stress shift to the penultimate and the last syllable of the whole sequence, and in Mallorca and Menorca Catalan, with stress shift to the last syllable. We argue that stress shift in Formentera Catalan conforms directly to the unmarked pattern of nominal stress in Catalan, that is, a right-aligned moraic trochee, with the constraint All-Feet-Right undominated, leading to final and penultimate stress. In Barcelona Catalan, the effects of this constraint are inhibited by an anti-alignment constraint prohibiting the right edge of a foot from coinciding with the right edge of a clitic. In Mallorca and Menorca Catalan, stress shift is also understood as a strategy to meet the unmarked nominal
stress pattern of Catalan, although in these dialects the anti-alignment constraint is also undominated, leading to catalexis, in this case a melodically empty mora, and thus to final stress.",0
"We investigate how saturation of different theta-roles by the non-head constituent correlates with derivational suffixes and, in turn, with the event structures compatible with those suffixes. We also investigate XP realisations of themes, causers and instruments in deverbal nominal and participial constructions and which ±agentive and/or ±process/episodic sub-readings allow which type of argument. It turns out that for each theta-role, the contexts that allow an XP realisation are exactly the complement of the contexts that would allow compounding of that same theta-role. We take this complementarity to be an indirect argument in favour of (i) divorcing argument licensing from argument selection and (ii) dissociating argument introduction from event-structure-related heads, which then potentially reaffirms the role of roots in (first phase) syntax.",0
"The topic of this study is grammatical tone (GT), which I define as a tonological operation that is not general across the phonological grammar, and is restricted to the context of a specific morpheme or construction. In typologizing grammatical tone, I frame it in terms of dominance effects (Kiparsky & Halle 1977, Kiparsky 1984), and divide GT into two types. Dominant GT systemically deletes the underlying tone of the target, while non-dominant GT does not systemically delete it. From a survey of GT, I develop a typological principle called the dominant GT asymmetry, which states that within a multi-morphemic constituent, the dominant trigger is a dependent (e.g. a modifier of affix), and the target is a lexical head or a dependent structurally closer to the lexical head. In this way, dominance is always directed 'inward' within morphological hierarchical structure, supporting earlier statements such as Alderete's (2001a, 2001b) 'Strict Base Mutation'. 


For any theoretical model of dominant vs. non-dominant GT, I show there are three problems that must be addressed: the origin problem (where does the grammatical tune come from), the erasure problem (why do the underlying tones of the target go unrealized), and the scope problem (what determines where the grammatical tune docks, i.e. its scope).


Under this theory, the origin problem is attributed to floating tones which are part of the underlying representation of the trigger. A major claim is that there is no representational difference between dominant and non-dominant tone: both involve floating tonemes. I implement my model within Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1993), whereby triggers of dominant GT are not constructions (as in classic Cophonology Theory – Inkelas 1998), but rather individual vocabulary items (following Sande & Jenks 2017). Dominant triggers have a special cophonology which ranks a constraint enforcing dominance higher than default constraints. This dominant constraint should be understood as a special type of faithfulness: correspondence between a matrix derivation and an abstract basemap consisting of only unvalued tone bearing units, e.g. an input-output basemap //ⒽⓁ + ττ// --> \\τ́τ̀\\. This addresses the erasure problem. The central insight here is that dominant GT should be characterized as a special type of paradigm uniformity effect, a hypothesis referred to as dominance as transparadigmatic uniformity.


To address the scope problem I develop a theory in which syntactic structure is mapped to a hierarchical morpho-phonological tree via an operation at spell-out called hierarchy exchange. Within instances of dominant GT, a mother node in the morpho-phonological tree consists of the trigger of the grammatical tune (one daughter) and the target (the other daughter). The cophonology of the trigger scopes over the entire sequence, with cophonologies applying cyclically at each node resulting in 'layers' of grammatical tone. 


A major component of this model is that hierarchy exchange preserves the inside-out derivational history of the syntactic module by referencing asymmetrical c-command. In this way, syntax/phonology interface models which appeal to c-command are essentially correct, the most relevant being McPherson (2014) and McPherson & Heath (2016). I conclude that the real legacy of c-command may not be linearization (Kayne 1994), but rather is in delimiting the scope of morphologically-triggered phonological operations.",0
"Polish vowel backing involves the integration of the vocalic nodes marked for feature [open] into the structure of the stems. The floating vocalic nodes constitute the realization of the categorizing N-heads merged with the roots. The items which always possess front vowels in the context of the palatalized consonant are represented with their final vowel-consonant sequences sharing the V-place nodes, thus any instance of palatalization will always affect both the vowel and the consonant. Such items, as well as what Gussmann (1980) calls 'positive exceptions to Backing' (e.g. kobi/et/+a 'woman, nom, sg.' and bi/es/ 'devil, nom, sg.') realize the root and the N-head by means of the stem exponent. The items which show backing in spite of the presence of palatalizing suffixes (e.g. śl/adz'/+ik 'trace, dim, nom, sg.') will be shown to be in fact complex words composed of the root, N-head realized as the backing autosegment, and an N/A-head realized as a palatalizing suffix.",0
"This PhD dissertation investigates non-finite adverbial subordinate clauses in Udmurt (Uralic; Russian Federation). The goal of the thesis goal is two-fold: firstly, to provide a description of the various non-finite adverbial clauses in Udmurt with special reference to their morphosyntax and syntax. Secondly, the Udmurt data is analysed using the tools of generative grammar.
The core part of the dissertation (Chapters 3-5) focus on the following questions. Chapter 3 provides an overall description of non-finite clauses in Udmurt by addressing the following issues: (i) the notion of finiteness, and the criteria for distinguishing finite and non-finite clauses in Udmurt; (ii) the classification of Udmurt non-finite clauses, with special reference to nominalizations; (iii) the morphosyntactic properties of non-finite relative, argument and adverbial clauses. Chapter 4 deals with the internal structure of Udmurt non-finite adverbial clauses. Firstly, I discuss the typologically well-established category of converbs. Then, I discuss the internal syntax of non-finite adverbial clauses. Chapter 5 discusses several topics related to subjects of non-finite adverbial clause, such as subject agreement, the alternation between null and overt subjects and adjunct control.",0
"We first define vagueness and distinguish it from relativity and ambiguity. We then proceed to characterize the sorites or heap paradox and present its philosophical implications. The paradox can be summarized as follows: if removing one grain from a heap does not turn it into a non-heap, we can successively remove grains from a heap until we arrive at a one-grain (or zero-grain) heap. Hence, from apparently sensible premises and by apparently sensible reasoning at arrive at a strikingly absurd conclusion.

We then consider Williamson's (1994) epistemic theory of vagueness, whose main postulate is that a sharp boundary between a heap and a non-heap exists, but we are ignorant of it. We reject Williamson's epistemic theory on several grounds: it makes counterintuitive assumptions which violate our understanding of language and has counterintuitive entailments which need not be accepted. Moreover, it requires accepting metaphysical stances, which demand other approaches can avoid.

To arrive at a different theory of vagueness, we consider the ideal epistemic conditions for everyday language terms such as thin, and what they can tell about the philosophical question of vagueness. Subsequently, we show that scientific vocabulary behaves in the relevant respects just like the common-sense informal words such as thin. Finally, we turn to Wittgenstein (1953) to show what light the picture of language sketched in Philosophical Investigations sheds on the question of vagueness and how a fuller understanding of language's versatility can accommodate the nature of vague predicates. Adapting Wittgenstein's theory of meaning as use, we conclude that the sorites paradox arises from a misapplication of language and can be avoided if real-life linguistic practices are given priority in our theorizing about language.",0
"In many Berber varieties, causative and reciprocal verbs are built by means of monoconsonantal prefixes attached to a stem. These prefixes are realized as single or geminated depending on the properties of the stem. In this paper, it is argued that an initial templatic site is responsible for the length variation of the prefixes. Under specific licensing conditions, the initial site hosts the causative and the reciprocal prefixes by means of two distinct operations, namely movement and spreading. Moreover, complex combinations of those prefixes (causative + reciprocal, reciprocal + causative) feed apparently unrelated phenomena of selective harmony and dissimilation. They are argued to follow directly from the use of the initial site as part of the verb domain. Handled in syntactic structure, the initial site further allows accounting for the cooccurrence restrictions that the causative and the imperfective markers undergo: it is proposed that the causative takes precedence over the imperfective because it is generated lower in the structure under the vP. The same reasoning holds for the incompatibility of imperfective gemination with the reciprocal marker. It is precisely this type of restrictions that strictly phonological analyses fail to address.",0

"This paper is an inquiry about the subcomponent of the Extended Projection Principle (EPP) that is relevant for second position phenomena: the Left Edge Filling Trigger (LEFT). LEFT basically amounts to a classical morphological obligatory exponence effect, except it is instantiated at the sentence level. It crosslinguistically operates in a postsyntactic realizational morphological module. I show that LEFT is an active rule of Universal Grammar, providing empirical arguments from Breton, a Celtic VSO language showing an extra conspicuous V2 requirement. I propose a radical reanalysis of language typology of word order. Classical V2 languages are conspicuously V2. SVO is a subtype. So-called V1 languages are either predicate fronting languages (Tense second), or inconspicuously V2. I discuss a crosslinguistic typology of LEFT effects, with great attention to inconspicuous satisfiers, among them null expletives for which I present evidence. I argue accordingly for a drastic extension of the typology of expletives.",0
"Under the framework of syntactic cartography, a new branch of generative grammar, this paper uses the methodology of Split Light Verb Hypothesis to analyze the cartography of hai in Chinese. hai has the original meaning of ""to hurt"" or "" to damage"" and it is followed by a patient NP.  Later on in the history, hai can be followed a verb, an adjective or a NP that is not a patient of hai. Combined with the linguistic data from Mandarin Chinese and Chinese dialect, we classify hai into three types based on their semantic meaning: DO-type hai, BE-type hai (phrasal level) and BE-type hai (lexical level). Based on the comparison of BE-type hai (phrasal level) and BE-type hai (lexical level), this study supports the Lexicalist Assumption (Chomsky 1970): words are formed in the lexicon and their internal configurations are not subject to syntactic rules.",0
"In the vast literature on the semantics of speech and attitude reports, communicative reception reports ('John heard/read that Mary's retiring') have been unjustly neglected. What makes these reports interesting is their hybrid nature: they can be like speech reports in semi-faithfully reporting another person's speech act (in which case they, unlike 'believe' or 'hope', can take direct quotation); but they can also behave more like belief reports in describing the subject as being the holder of a certain mental/information state (as in 'the doctor told John he has pneumonia but all he heard is that he's dying'). In Turkish, reception reports overtly express both a 'hear' and a 'say' component. We take this surface structure literally, analyzing 'x heard that p' roughly as 'x heard LOG saying that p', where LOG can pick up (i) the reported speaker, leading to a speech report interpretation, or (ii) the matrix subject, leading to an attitudinal interpretation (where 'say' is understood as a internal, mental speech/thought act). Assuming that 'say' can house a monstrous indexical shifter (Şener & Şener 2012), we now predict that on the speech report reading, embedded 1s can shift to the reported speaker, while on the attitudinal reading they can shift to the reported hearer.  We provide novel Turkish data showing that first person indexicals under reception verbs in Turkish are indeed three ways ambiguous (no shift, shift to subject, shift to reported speaker), and propose an analysis couched in an event-based, conjunctive analysis of attitude/speech reporting (cf. Kratzer 2006).",0

"The goal of this paper is to make the case for a radical exemplar account of child language acquisition, under which unwitnessed forms are produced and comprehended by on-the-fly analogy across multiple stored exemplars, weighted by their degree of similarity to the target with regard to the task in hand. Across the domains of (1) word meanings, (2) morphologically inflected words, (3) n-grams, (4) sentence-level constructions and (5) phonetics and phonology, accounts based on independently-represented abstractions (whether formal rules or prototype categories) fail for two reasons. First, it is not possible to posit abstractions that delineate possible and impossible forms; e.g., that (a) rule in pool tables and data tables, but rule out chairs, (b) rule in ""mist"" and rule out ""missid"" as the phonological form of the past tense of miss, (c) rule in both John feared Bill and John frightened Bill but rule out *John laughed Bill. Second, for each domain, empirical data provide evidence of exemplar storage that cannot be captured by putative abstractions: e.g. speakers prefer and/or show an advantage for (1) exemplar variation even within word-meaning ""category boundaries"", (2) novel inflected forms that are similar to existing exemplars, (3) n-grams that have occurred frequently in the input, (4) SVO sentences with he as SUBJECT and it as OBJECT and (5) repeated productions of ""the same"" word that are phonologically similar or, better still, identical. An exemplar account avoids an intractable lumping-or-splitting dilemma facing abstraction-based accounts and provides a unitary explanation of language acquisition across all domains; one that is consistent with models and empirical findings from the neuroimaging literature.",0
"LF impoverishment in DM
and polite addressee pronouns
SUMMARY: Couched in the framework of DM (Distributed Morphology), this paper derives the
typology of polite addressee pronouns with the help of 'LF impoverishment rules'. This paper argues that LF impoverishment deserves more attention than the received view, thus updating DM with new typological data.
PUZZLE: In Mandarin, the personal pronoun nín means 'you' and it's used to address a single person politely and it only has this function. I call this type of pronouns 'dedicated polite addressee pronouns'. Conversely, in French, the pronoun vous also means 'you', but it can not only be used to address a single person politely but also a plurality of people in all possible scenarios. This is a case of syncretism and the derivational process of such a pronoun can be roughly modelled by proposing that there is an LF impoverishment process that deletes a plural number (PL) feature:
(1) French: (source form) 2nd pl(target form) 2nd polite sg
a. Syntactic input: {D HON PL...}
(HON for 'honorificity')
b. PL→/[__HON] (Impoverishment rule at LF) c. {D PL...}/vu/ (Vocabulary Insertion rule at PF) For convenience, I describe the uninterpretable PL in (1b) as 'marking politeness' because this feature is associated with HON feature which gives rise to politeness. In fact, based on the current typology (ca. 70 languages or so) that I gathered from WALS and my own data pool, a good range of features 'mark' politeness and I hypothesize that these features are also targets of deletion triggered by HON, as (1b) shows. Apart from the French pattern, where second person plural pronouns are used as second person singular polite pronouns, (2-6) shows that, together with (1) and 'dedicated polite addressee pronouns' as in Mandarin, polite addressee pronouns have at least 8 patterns, in which other features like dual number (DU), paucal number (PAUCAL), feminine (FEM) and reflexive (REFL) also 'mark' politeness.
(2) Muna (Van den Berg 1989): (source form) 1st incl(target form) 2nd sg polite
a. Syntactic input: {D HON DU...}
b. DU→/[__HON] (Impoverishment rule at LF) c. {D DU ...}/intaidi/ (Vocabulary Insertion rule at PF)
(3) Modern Standard German: (source form) 3rd pl(target form) 2nd sg polite a. Syntactic input: {D HON PL...}
 
  
 
b. PL→/[__HON] c. {D PL... }/zi:/
(4) Italian (source from) 3rd sg fem(target form) 2nd sg polite
a. Syntactic input: {D HON FEM...}
b. FEM→ / [__ HON]
c. {D FEM...}/le/ (Vocabulary Insertion rule at PF)
(5) Fijian: (source form) 2nd plural/paucal/dual(target form) 2nd sg polite
a. Syntactic input: {D HON PL/PAUCAL/DU...}
b. PL/PAUCAL/DU1 → / [__ HON] (Impoverishment rule at LF) c. {D DU...}/(o)mudrau~(o)drau/
or {D PAUCAL...}/(o)mudou~(o)dou/
or {D PL...}/(o)munnu~(o)nuu/ (Vocabulary Insertion rule at PF)
1 The LF rules for DU and PAUCAL impoverishment are an oversimplification here. DU and PAUCAL are assumed to be more complex number features than PL and could presumably be made of more than one sub- features. For example, in Ackema and Neeleman (2018), DU may consist of AUG (for 'Augmented') and MIN (for 'minimal'). In Harley and Ritter (2002), PAUCAL is made up of AUG, MIN and GROUP.
I assume that one HON feature triggers one impoverishment rule of one syntactic feature at a time. For pronouns of complex feature values like DU and PAUCAL, HON features could be stacked: HON-HON, or HON-HON-HON, which could trigger the deletion of two or three syntactic features. In fact, the stacking of HON features has its empirical basis, which is omitted here due to limited space.
(Impoverishment rule at LF) (Vocabulary Insertion rule at PF)
(Impoverishment rule at LF)
 
(6) Hungarian: (source form) anaphoric reflexive pronoun(target form) polite 2nd sg
a. Syntactic input: {D HON REFL (PL)...}
b. REFL → /[__ HON] (Impoverishment rule at LF) d.{D REFL PL}Önök or {D REFL}Ön (Vocabulary Insertion rule at PF) It is not attested in my typology that case features can 'mark' politeness in addressee pronouns. A priori, one would think that using feature(s) which has no interpretation to begin with to mark politeness is the optimal strategy. For example, case features. If one adopts this route, then there is no need to have special rules post-syntactically to delete politeness marking features at LF, and any potential disparities in form and interpretation are avoided. The fact that a variation of other kinds of features like traditional phi features and REFL can be used makes it all the more interesting to ask why case features are not used in marking politeness in polite addressee pronouns. Phi features, after all, is but a cover term for person, number, and gender features.
PROPOSAL: I hypothesize that the key to the puzzle has to do with the internal distribution of pronominal features and the locality condition on the licensing of HON feature, constraining how potential politeness marking features would interact with HON in the syntax within a pronoun. Specifically, I argue that case features cannot interact with HON in the syntax due to the fact that access of HON to case features are 'blocked' by the DP/NmaxP2 phase boundary. HON can interact with phi features and other DP internal features like REFL because these features are within the DP/NmaxP phase. I relativise this 'interaction' to a licensing condition (7).
(7) The Threshold Requirement: HON triggers deletion of features that HON is dependent on, after being licensed and rendered active via Agree-Link3 by features that HON selects in the syntax.
LF Impoverishment: 'Impoverishment' normally refers to post-syntactic deletion rules at PF before phonological interpretation. 'LF impoverishment' is much less well known than PF impoverishment. However, LF impoverishment, namely deleting features post-syntactically before semantic interpretation, has already started to emerge since at least Grimshaw (1997), her idea is that do has semantic content, but it's very minimal. A do-support do, however, does not have semantic content at all, which equals suggesting that there is LF impoverishment of the content of do. Heim (2008) discusses a type of phenomenon that could be potentially analysed as a case of LF impoverishment: phi features on bound pronouns. In a sentence like Only I did my work (Heim, 2008), the 1st person feature on bound pronoun my is not interpreted when this sentence means 'x is such that x is the only person that did x's homework and x refers to the speaker'. The non-interpretation of 1st person feature on the bound pronoun my could be potentially seen as undergoing deletion of 1st person (or [+author, +participant]) feature. Nevins (2008) explicitly identifies LF impoverishment as a parallel deletion process compared to the PF impoverishment in a Y-model grammar and termed LF impoverishment 'deprivation'. He gave an example from the language Santali, in which the first person inclusive is used as second person singular with a threatening pragmatic effect towards the addressee. The analysis implied in Nevins (2008) is that an LF impoverishment rule changes the features for 1st person and non-singular number into 2nd person and singular.
Further PREDICTIONS: This paper not only accounts for attested polite addressee pronouns, but also predicts impossible polite addressee pronouns. Apart from hypothetical case-marked polite addressee pronouns explained in this abstract, this paper further predicts that 1st person singular pronouns, 1st person exclusive pronouns, masculine personal pronouns (in a 2-way gender system) and 2nd person singular pronouns cannot be recruited in any language as polite addressee pronouns, which is substantiated by the current typology.
Future EXPERIMENT(s): I assume that it is a surprising bias that the majority of languages that have a polite distinction in addressee pronouns are like that of French (1). Inspired by Jennifer Culbersten and colleagues' work (eg. Culbertson and Kirby, 2016), this paper proposes that it has to do with a learning bias which is strengthened by cultural factors: simplicity.

"As young children vividly illustrate with their performance on the wug-test (Berko 1958), the ability to generalize linguistic patterns to novel items is a core property of language. It thus comes as a surprise when we stumble into a dark and dusty corner of language where our boundless linguistic productivity has unexpectedly failed. We propose that such lexical gaps arise in precisely those linguistic contexts for which the Tolerance Principle (Yang 2005, 2016) identifies no productive generalizations. We illustrate this proposal with detailed case studies from Spanish, Polish, and Russian.",1
"The current paper presents results of two experiments attempting to replicate with Polish speakers a Stroop-like interference of grammatical number with the counting task, first reported by Berent et al. (2005) for Hebrew. Both experiments tested the influence of the type of number morphology (marked with overt suffix vs. unmarked) of nouns on the strength of the interference effect. Additionally, the second experiment investigated the processing of nouns with a mismatch between grammatical and conceptual number and tested the possible effect of animacy on number interpretation in order to determine the time at which the information about grammatical number is activated. The first experiment showed a significant interaction between the grammatical number and visual numerosity of the counted words and the effect of markedness, with marked singulars producing a bigger congruency effect than unmarked singulars. However, in the second experiment the influence of morphology was reversed and the overall effects were considerably weaker.",0
"The main goal of the reported study is to test the cross-linguistic validity of the existing psycholinguistic models of morphological processing by contributing the results of a masked priming lexical decision experiment on the processing of Polish semantically transparent and opaque compounds. All these models are concerned with the question of whether morphologically complex words are decomposed during online processing or whether they are stored as chunks in the mental lexicon. We contribute new data from
Polish showing that reaction times to target words semantically related to the heads of transparent compounds were significantly faster than to target words semantically related to the heads of opaque compounds in Polish. This may be interpreted as evidence in favour of the view that semantically transparent compound words are decomposed and we access the lemmas of their constituent elements whereas semantically opaque compounds are not decomposed and there is no access to their constituent lemmas.",0
"Traditionally, languages are assumed to minimally manifest a distinction between nouns and verbs. This assumption has occasionally been debated in the theoretical linguistic literature, in particular in the context of challenging verbal noun constructions that simultaneously manifest nominal and verbal features. From a psycholinguistic perspective, one of the most promising diagnostic criteria for determining whether a given word belongs to the category NOUN or VERB is an event-related brain potential (ERP) component, P200, whose amplitude is larger for verbs than for nouns. So far, a challenge for the interpretation of the P200 has been whether this component reflects verbal (e.g., action) semantics, lexical category or verb-related morphological operation. In the present study we report an ERP experiment whose goal was to contribute to a better understanding of the nature of the ""verbal"" P200 component by monitoring the comprehension of Polish morphologically related finite verbs, converbs, and verbal nouns. Thereby, we manipulated the syntactic category and morphological complexity of the critical words while keeping their
semantics identical. The results show that finite verbs engender a smaller amplitude of the P200 component than less prototypical ""verbs"" such as verbal nouns and converbs. Based on this observation, we argue that the P200 component reflects the brain activation triggered by the demands of verb-related morphological integration processes performed on the verbal base of derived forms.",1
"This paper analyzes a certain class of misalignments found in contemporary Irish in the relation between syntactic and phonological representations. The mismatches analyzed turn on the phonological requirements of focus (Verum Focus in particular) and of ellipsis and on how the two sets of requirements interact. It argues that the phonological mechanisms of ellipsis can be overridden when the phonological requirements of F-marking need to be satisfied. The analysis requires a theoretical framework in which the postsyntactic computation is characterized by parallel and simultaneous optimization. In particular, it is argued that certain facets of ellipsis, morphophonology, and prosody are computed in parallel, as in classic Optimality Theory. The analysis also relies crucially on a kind of head movement (from specifier to a commanding head position) whose existence is predicted by current conceptions of phrase structure but which seems to be little documented.",0

Depending on the position of the bleached verb, the -(i)p suffix which follows the lexical verb in lieu of finite inflection realizes either an Inner Aspect head within the verbal domain or an Event head outside the verbal domain.",0
"Definite descriptions may give rise to anaphoric interpretations. Addressing this, work in the field of semantics has led to syntactic claims that anaphora-encoding indices are syntactically represented in the DP (i.a. Elbourne 2005; Schwarz 2009). An open question is, however, how these indices interact syntactically with another type of anaphoric element within the DP: modifiers. An example of one such modifier is 'same', which readily participates in anaphora cross-linguistically. 

In this dissertation, I address this interaction by investigating the morphosyntactic properties of anaphoric DPs both with and without 'same'. Rejecting the null hypothesis that same is simply a modifier that appears in an otherwise unchanged DP syntax, I argue that, while anaphoric definite descriptions do in fact house indices in their structure, anaphora with 'same' arises from a different source: 'same' is a degree head that encodes anaphora by selecting an index of its own -- a common trait of degree elements more generally. This proposal leads to testable predictions, which I show to be borne out with data from German and from fieldwork on Washo, a Native American isolate.

Crucial to the treatment of same as a degree head is an account of its use in introducing 'as'-relatives. I argue that while the degree head 'same' selects for an index on its anaphoric use, an 'as'-relative may occupy the same structural position in cases of clausal modification, obviating the need for an antecedent. I give an analysis of as-relatives assuming a matching structure of relative clauses, and further relate this type of embedded clause to restrictive relatives introduced by 'same'.

Finally, the claim that 'same' is a degree head rather than an adjective raises pertinent questions about the nature of inflection. The dissertation therefore addresses problems posed by German for current accounts of nominal concord, which are posed by degree modifiers of various types. I argue for a post-syntactic account along the lines of Norris (2014), for whom inflection is achieved by the insertion of Agr nodes onto individual heads post-syntactically, but argue instead that Agr is inserted phrasally, at DegP, which I show to account for a wide range of inflectional patterns.

In sum, the dissertation addresses three core topics, concerning: i) the way anaphoric interpretations arise from distinct structural sources, both within and across languages; ii) the relationship between individuals and degree expressions; and iii)  the nature of attributive degree modification.",0
"A key piece of evidence in favor of recent proposals that speech act roles are encoded in the syntax comes from languages with ""allocutivity""-agreement with non-thematic addressees. This paper analyzes the syntax of allocutive morphemes in the best studied allocutive language, Basque. It is shown that properties of these morphemes, including morpheme order and the way allocutive morphemes condition exponence of neighboring heads can be modeled using standard assumptions about cliticization, head-adjunction and case in Basque. The analysis lends support to a central idea in recent literature on the syntax of speech act roles, namely that addressees are encoded by a nominal element introduced in the left periphery. This paper proposes that, in Basque, this nominal element is overt, with a distribution that obeys principles similar to those for thematic addressees.",0
"In some languages with DOM, the exponents of DOM and dative are homophonous, e.g. in Spanish and Hindi. I argue that this pattern is not due to DOM objects and indirect objects being represented identically in syntax, but due to syncretism between accusative and dative case in these languages. This is indicated by a number of syntactic tests which group DOM objects with morphologically zero-coded direct objects, rather than with indirect objects, including nominalisation, relativisation, controlling secondary predicates, and passivisation. I suggest that languages with a ditransitive alternation between direct/indirect and primary/secondary objects provide further support for the syntactic difference of DOM and dative objects.",0

I present new data, which falsify the well-accepted idea that no in the modification construction is a meaningless particle inserted at PF simply for morphological adjustment (Watanabe 2010). I also discuss the NP-ellipsis pattern,
which has motivated the traditional dichotic approach in Japanese literature, and show that a consensus that the availability of NP-ellipsis depends on the argument status of the stranded possessor cannot be maintained once a wider range of data are taken into consideration. Lastly, arguments

"This paper investigates the inflectional system of the nominal domain in Esahie (Central-Tano, Kwa, Niger-Congo) by focusing on agreement and syncretism. It offers a comprehensive description of these inflectional phenomena in an attempt to test and account for the strength of the inflectional system of an otherwise under-described language. It shows among other things that morpho-syntactic features including number, person, animacy, and case, all enter the Esahie agreement system in various contexts.
Adopting Corbett's (2006) criteria for canonicity of agreement, this work demonstrates
that, in Esahie, DP-internal agreement is more canonical than anaphora agreement. A general paucity of inflection marking is argued to account for the several instances of
syncretism in Esahie. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that syncretism is pervasive in the pronominal system of Esahie. Collected largely through elicitation from native speakers, the Esahie data discussed in this work provides empirical support for the irreducibility hypothesis proposed by Stump (2016). Hence, on the theoretical level, this work argues for adopting a paradigm-based approach to inflectional morphology over a morpheme-based approach to inflectional morphology.",0
"This dissertation presents what is, to my knowledge, the first in-depth theoretical syntactic investigation of a Mixtec language: San Martín Peras Mixtec. The syntax of this language is explored through the lens of a process called pronoun doubling, which duplicates the phi-features of a nominal with a preverbal morpheme that is morphophonologically identical to a regular pronoun.


The narrow question of this dissertation is what the synchronic analysis of pronoun doubling is.  Ultimately, I argue that, despite initial appearances, the ``pronoun'' in pronoun doubling constructions is not a true pronominal, but rather the morphophonological exponent of a phi-agreement process that targets topics. 

But as this process replicates $\varphi$-features, I consider two possibilities. First, I investigate if pronoun doubling could be a form of clitic doubling. I argue that clitic doubling is best derived by phrasal movement of the doubled nominal, followed by reduction of the higher copy to a clitic. Therefore, in order to diagnose clitic doubling within this ``Move-and-Reduce'' framework, we must look for evidence of movement in pronoun doubling constructions. 

I first consider A-movement. I describe a novel A-movement process which I term ``quantifier fronting.'' I then show that none of the A-movement properties of quantifier fronting can be found in pronoun doubling. I also show that A-movement in SMP Mixtec is typologically unusual in being much less restricted than A'-movement.

A'-movement in SMP Mixtec shows several interesting properties. First, it demonstrates an A'-extraction restriction reminiscent of syntactic ergativity: external arguments may not undergo A'-movement. I investigate this restriction through the properties of two A'-constructions. I first investigate restrictive relative clauses, which require a resumption strategy in order to avoid the ban against extraction of external arguments. I then investigate content wh-questions, which avoid this ban by employing a movement construction that demonstrably lacks the properties of both A-movement and A'-movement. Crucially, no evidence for this extraction restriction is replicated in pronoun doubling constructions. 

As clitic doubling within this Move-and-Reduce framework does not seem like a viable option, I consider the possibility that pronoun doubling is a form of phi-agreement. Despite appearances, this turns out to be the best fit for several reasons. First, pronoun doubling obeys the PIC yet allows Closest Conjunct Agreement. Second, pronoun doubling yield novel variable-binding possibilities. That said, pronoun doubling is not vanilla phi-agreement for two reasons. First, both subjects and objects are equally accessible, depending on which is interpreted as a topic.


To account for this system, I develop a theory in which phi-agreement can target topics. This functions similarly to a traditional minimalist Case theory, in which nouns must stand in an Agree relation with some functional head in order to receive Case. I adapt this general approach to topic agreement by proposing that nominals which are to be interpreted as topics must stand in an Agree relation with a head Top, and Top also acts as a phi-probe.

The dissertation is organized as follows. Chapter 1 provides the necessary background on this language, including a brief syntactic and phonological overview. Chapter 1 also provides a detailed discussion of the prosodic conditions which restrict the appearance of topic agreement. Chapter 2 provides an extensive literature review of both phi-agreement and clitic doubling, including an exhaustive evaluation of the diagnostics which have been put forward to distinguish the two. In this chapter I also argue for why clitic doubling is best understood within a Move-and-Reduce framework. This approach to clitic doubling allows for intuitive argumentation for either clitic doubling or phi-agreement: clitic doubling constructions show the characteristics of movement chains, while phi-agreement does not.

With this background, Chapter 3 begins the investigation of movement constructions in San Martín Peras Mixtec by investigating A-movement. It begins with a detailed discussion of the syntax of embedded clauses. This is because failure to extract from finite embedded clauses is a common feature of A-movement cross-linguistically. In this language, though, it is difficult to tell which embedded clauses are finite because there is no non-finite verbal morphology and all embedded clauses have an overt subject. I argue that, despite appearances, this language distinguishes between Obligatory Control and simple pronominal coreference, despite this language's equivalent of PRO always being overt. This relation is mediated through a CP layer, which faithfully tracks when Obligatory Control occurs.

Once these aspects of the clause structure have been established, I demonstrate the A-movement properties of quantifier fronting, such as failure to reconstruct for scope or binding, and the ability to expand the variable and anaphora binding possibilities within a clause. I also show that A-movement in this language is much less restricted than A'-movement, despite being clause bounded. While A'-movement forbids extraction of possessors, objects of prepositions, and, as shown in Chapter 4, external arguments, A-movement shows no such restriction. Additionally, A'-movement, particular content wh-questions, require pied-piping with inversion, while A-movement is incompatible with it. Importantly for our purposes, pronoun doubling fails to show any of these A-chain properties: it fails to affect variable or anaphora binding, and it may not target objects of prepositions or possessors.

As pronoun doubling fails to show the properties of an A-chain, Chapter 4 considers the possibility that the movement chain involves is an A'-chain. This requires an extensive investigation of A'-movement in this language. I demonstrate that San Martín Peras Mixtec shows a strict A'-extraction restriction, in addition to the restictions shown in Chapter 3: external arguments may not undergo A'-extraction. This restriction, while similar in many ways, is fundamentally different from syntactic ergativity for two reasons. First, San Martín Peras Mixtec is not morphologically ergative. Second, intransitive predicates show varying behavior, with unergative subjects patterns with transitive subjects while unaccusative subjects pattern with transitive objects. 

After this extraction restiction is established, I demonstrate its properties in more detail. First I investigate restrictive relative clauses, which require resumption of external arguments. I show that this resumption strategy fails to show any properties of movement. This allows the language to straightforwardly avoid the A'-extraction restriction. Second, I investigate the syntax of content wh-questions. These also show the effects of the A'-extraction restriction, albeit the repair is different. Content wh-questions of external arguments do involve movement, but I demonstrate that this movement process fails to show the hallmark characteristics of either A-movement or A'-movement. This also allows the language to satisfy the restriction against A'-extraction of external arguments. I conclude by demonstrating that this extraction restriction that is so crucial to understanding A'-constructions in this language is not replicable in pronoun doubling constructions because external arguments may be freely targeted.

As pronoun doubling fails to show the diagnostic movement chain properties of clitic doubling, Chapter 5 considers the possibility that this process is a phi-agreement. After cataloging the phi-agreement properties of pronoun doubling, such as observance of the PIC, Closest Conjunct Agreement, and the failure to affect variable and anaphora binding, I develop a theory of topic agreement. First, I demonstrate that topic agreement is not an especially rare phenomenon cross-linguistically, having been reported in a range of languages from Northern Khanty (Uralic, Russia), Oromo (Cushitic, Ethiopia), and many others. While the semantic investigation is cursory, I demonstrate that topichood is the best notion to determine which nominals will be targeted in pronoun doubling constructions. Finally, I present the formal analysis of topic agreement, which I described above.",0
"Based on the cross- and intra-linguistic distribution of Person Case Constraint (PCC) effects, I argue that there can be no agreement in phi-features (person, number, gender oun-class) which systematically lacks a morpho-phonological footprint. That is, there is no such thing as ""abstract"" phi-agreement, null across the entire paradigm. Applying the same diagnostic to instances of clitic doubling, we see that these do involve syntactic agreement. This cannot be because clitic doubling is agreement; it behaves like movement (and unlike agreement) in a variety of respects. Nor can this be because clitic doubling, qua movement, is contingent on prior agreement – since the claim that all movement depends on prior agreement is demonstrably false.
I propose that clitic doubling requires prior agreement because it is an instance of non-local head movement, and movement of X0 to Y0 always requires a prior syntactic relationship between Y0 and XP. In local head movement (à la Travis 1984), this requirement is trivially satisfied by (c-)selection. But in non-local cases, agreement must fill this role.",0
"This paper proposes a novel analysis of word order in Brazilian Portuguese (BP), based on a hybrid model of EPP satisfaction. It is proposed that the subject requirement or EPP is a [uD] feature on T which can be satisfied either by DP movement or by movement of an inflected verb bearing a [D] feature in BP. This, it is claimed, offers an explanatory account of basic word order patterns in BP. External argument DPs, merged above V, are closer to T than V, meaning that they must raise to satisfy the EPP, predicting SV(O) order with transitive and unergative predicates, including transitive psych-predicates. Internal arguments are merged below V, however, and so with unaccusatives, it is movement of the verb bearing a [uD] feature which satisfies the EPP, giving rise to VS order. With copular verbs which take small clause complements, a similar affect holds, as the copular verb can satisfy the EPP. Verb movement can also satisfy the EPP in impersonal contexts, hence the fact that BP lacks overt expletives.",0
"This paper explores the labeling hypothesis of Chomsky 2013, 2015 in relation to DP-internal syntax. Possessors and external arguments (EA) of nouns that have them give rise to [XP, YP] configurations, which are problematical for labeling under Chomsky's assumptions. 

But in languages with grammatical gender, N  differ from the clausal counterparts V/v in having intrinsic phi-features. My paper claims that gender concord between n and a possessor or EA labels nP via shared features, enabling these arguments to surface nP-internally. Bantu languages (among others) show this feature-sharing clearly in the form of overt concord on the morpheme 'of' that introduces a lexical argument. 

In contrast, possessors in a number of genderless languages, including Turkish and Yup'ik, must raise to permit labeling of nP, and surface in a high functional category whose head can agree with them in the DP-internal counterpart to subject agreement (Abney 1987). 

The paper contributes to an ongoing debate regarding the mechanics of concord and its place in the grammar: is it a consequence of Agree in the syntax, or a distinct, perhaps post-syntactic process? Assuming that it feeds the labeling algorithm and bleeds DP-internal possessor agreement and possessor raising, I argue that gender-number concord are part of narrow syntax and the outcome of Agree. 

My proposals are based on data from Bantu, Afro-asiatic, and Romance languages on the one hand and Turkish, Hungarian, Yup'ik, Chamorro, and Tsutujil on the other. I also discuss some less transparent facts of Maasai (where a possessive agreement morpheme agrees bidirectionally), and NP-fronting as a path to successful DP-internal labeling.",0
"This is a survey article about the semantics of free relatives. Issues discussed include the basic denotation of free relatives (detailed comparison between the definite, universal, and indefinite positions), semantics of ever free relatives (expressing ignorance, indifference, or non-modal kinds of variation), and the issue of how free relatives get derived compositionally. The article contains a summary of what has been discovered in the past quarter of a century, but it also discusses novel crosslinguistic data, which suggest that the so called non-modal readings of ever free relatives seem to be most common crosslinguistically (despite the impression created by the literature on English free relatives).",0
"The wanna facts are a classic Poverty of Stimulus (PoS) problem: Wanna is grammatical in certain contexts (Who do you want PRO to play with?) but not others (Who do you want who to play with you?). On a standard analysis, ""contraction"" to wanna is blocked by some empty constituents (WH-copies) but not others (PRO). All empty constituents are inaudible, so it has been unclear how restrictions on them could be learned. Children's reported knowledge of the wanna facts (Crain & Thornton, 1998) has therefore been attributed to a principle of Universal Grammar (UG). In two experiments, we demonstrate that children's use of wanna is not in fact adultlike and that error rates are modulated by the frequency of the embedded verb (play). These results suggest that if there is a UG principle, children appear not to know that it is relevant, raising important questions about what learning mechanisms enable children to circumvent the input's apparent poverty.",0

"This paper introduces a new model (henceforth the Mapping and Pruning [MaP] model) of the relation between syntactic and prosodic structure. It divides the mapping procedure into two parts, a cross-linguistically invariant initial mapping, which feeds cross-linguistically variable pruning operations enforcing phonological well-formedness.  A few assumptions concerning the interaction between the initial mapping and syntactic phase structure, combined with a very simple prosodic-structure building algorithm, give us generalisations about the link between prosody and syntax which must otherwise be stipulated. In particular, we recover the fact that lexical categories appear to be visible to prosodic processes but functional categories do not, and the fact that head-directionality in syntax tends to correlate with the location of phrasal edges in phonology. It is also shown that the model in question produces recursive structures in response to certain kinds of syntactic movement, and it is argued that recursive constituents in Irish and Chimwiini exemplify this phenomenon.  Because the mapping between syntax and prosody has a cross-linguistically invariant, deterministic component, this model offers a possible way of using prosodic structure as a precision tool to probe syntactic structure.",0
"This paper is an attempt to assess empirically whether, as often stated in
the literature, inflection is ""semantically more regular"" than derivation. We
reformulate the observation in terms of the stability of syntactic and semantic
contrasts within a morphological relation: inflectional contrasts are hypothesized to be more stable than derivational contrasts. We then propose an operational definition of contrasts between words as offset vectors in a distributional vector space of the kind familiar from distributional semantics. In the empirical part of the paper, we show that French data does validate the hypothesis for all pairings of an inflectional and a derivational relation that we were able to investigate.",0
"The (Italian) pair '*il luo libro' vs. 'il suo libro' ('the his/her book')
that is typical of Romance lends itself to an account of the first in terms of constraints also seen in the syntax of compounding, and to an account of the second that links its 's-', despite initial appearances, to what we think of as Romance reflexive 's-'.  We might informally call this pair an instance of suppletion, as long as we recognize that calling it suppletion falls short of an account.",0
"This article develops an analysis of the clitic co-occurrence restrictions found on transitive unaccusative verbs in Choctaw, and how they are (or are not) repaired. It turns out that the repair strategy of Absolutive Promotion, by which a typically-absolutive argument becomes ergative, is sensitive to standard syntactic notions of intervention and locality, implying that it involves a syntactic Agree relation. Regarding the clitic co-occurrence restrictions, I show that they can be captured with the Condition on Clitic Hosts---a condition that syntactic heads can host at most one clitic, adapted from the condition of the same name developed by Arregi & Nevins (2012) for Basque. By detailed comparison with Basque, we see that the Condition on Clitic Hosts and Absolutive Promotion are found in both languages. However, they do not have entirely the same effect: Absolutive Promotion in Choctaw can repair a different set of structures from those it can repair in Basque, and clitics are hosted on a different set of heads in Choctaw than in Basque.",0
"In Polish a single category-less root may be found in two or more verbs
which belong to different verbal classes. This observation suggests that
the established approach to deriving the exponents of verbal classes in
Polish, i.e. Czaykowska-Higgins (1998), was on the wrong track in
assuming that the identity of thematic vowels is dependent on the
specification of the root. This paper discusses several types of root ambiguity
and puts forward an alternative account in which it is the
specification of the category-defining V-heads as well as the aspectual
characteristics and argument structure that drive the exponence of Polish
verbs. It is also postulated that the traditional account which assumes the
existence of 8 verbal classes may be replaced with an approach which
postulates the existence of 5 classes. I show that not only does such an
approach capture certain affinities between Polish verbal classes, but also
predicts which verb (sub)classes will never share one and the same root.",0
"This paper proposes unifying the independently developed models of Output-Output Correspondence (OO-Corr) for morphophonology and Agreement by Projection (ABP) for phonology, both of which formalize the insight that linguistic units which are similar are intimately connected, a connection which fosters further similarity. I refer to this as OO-Corr via ABP. Agreement by Projection is a recent proposal in Hansson (2014) coming out of the Agreement by Correspondence literature, which states that constraints can enforce agreement of a feature across a 'projection' of segments. The central innovation of this paper is that I extend this notion of 'projection' to sets of outputs (e.g. outputs of a paradigm) over which agreement is enforced (e.g. with respect to root shape, word shape, etc.). I illustrate the OO-Corr via ABP model for different types of output-to-output similarity, including paradigmatic and transparadigmatic OO-Corr types involving networks of output forms. Finally, I argue that OO-Corr via ABP unites two distinct cases in the paradigm uniformity literature: 'majority rules effects' seen in McCarthy's (2005) work on Optimal Paradigms, and 'least marked effects' seen in Steriade's (1999, 2008) work on 'lexical conservatism'.",0
"This paper examines the interaction between syntactic structure and conditioned phonological alternations. We outline a novel model of the syntax-phonology interface, Cophonologies by Phase, which integrates Cophonology Theory (Orgun 1996, Inkelas et al. 1997, Anttila 2002, Inkelas & Zoll 2005, 2007) with Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1994) and Phase Theory (Chomsky 2001, Abels 2012, Bošković 2014). In our model, cophonologies are able to scope over spelled-out chunks of syntactic structure. The central innovation is an enriched conception of the lexicon. We propose that Vocabulary items contain three phonological components: 1) an underlying form containing (supra)segmental features, 2) a prosodic subcategorization frame or template, and 3) a subranking of constraints, any of which can be null. We present case studies illustrating how Cophonologies by Phase can account for conditioned phonological alternations in three languages: Hebrew, Kuria, and Guébie, all of which involve process morphology.",0
"In sign language, one may sometimes re-use a locus that originally referred to a spatial location in order to denote an individual found at that location ('Locative Shift'). We suggest that Locative Shift arises when a covert individual-denoting variable a is merged with  a location-denoting locus b to form a complex expression a_b, which denotes a situation stage of an individual.  We investigate basic properties of Locative Shift in ASL: the phenomenon extends to temporal and modal shift; indexical loci are not usually locative-shifted; Locative Shift may have interpretive consequences, some of which appear to be at-issue; and Locative Shift can occur in highly iconic cases, possibly even without prior establishment of a situation-denoting locus. We further investigate the behavior of the co-opted loci under predicate ellipsis.  The individual component of a locative-shifted locus can be bound, and in some cases its locative specification can be disregarded in the elided clause, under conditions that are reminiscent of the behavior of phi-features. In other cases, locative specifications are preserved under ellipsis, possibly even with elided indexical pronouns, whose overt counterparts resist Locative Shift. Some of our main findings can be replicated in LSF, although our data leave many questions open. Finally, we argue that some pointing gestures in English can undergo something like Locative Shift.",0
"In an artificial language experiment, participants were taught two different artificial languages consisting of English content words and novel morphological marking. The first of the languages had matching alignment in both case and agreement, as attested in natural languages such as Basque, Belhare and Tsez. The other language combined accusative case alignment with ergative agreement alignment, a combination which is apparently unattested amongst natural languages. There was no significant difference between the languages in terms of the proportion of participants that showed awareness of the agreement pattern, nor in the ability of aware participants to recall case markers and inflections during training, or select the correct verb inflection in the generation post-test. However, amongst participants who remained unaware of the agreement pattern there was a significant difference in recall of verb inflections and case markers during the exposure phase task – recall was more accurate in the (attested) language with matching case and agreement alignment than the (nonattested) language in which case and agreement alignment were unmatched. We take this as evidence that there is a cognitive bias against the unattested non-matching alignment, reflected in implicit learning.",1
"Theories of pronominal strength (e.g. Cardinaletti and Starke 1999) lead one to expect that sign language, just like spoken language, can have  morphologically distinct strong pronominals. We suggest that ASL (American Sign Language) and LSF (French Sign Language) might have such pronominals, characterized here by the fact that they may associate with ONLY even in the absence of prosodically marked focus.",0
"Following the development of Prosodic Hierarchy Theory (Selkirk 1984, 
Nespor & Vogel 1986), evidence has accumulated that prosodic categories 
may be recursively self-embedded (e.g. Selkirk 1995, Truckenbrodt 1999, 
Wagner 2010, Itô & Mester 2013, etc.). However, this conclusion is not 
universally accepted (e.g. Vogel 2009), and even the need for prosodic 
categories has been recently disputed (e.g. Scheer 2012). In this 
article I argue that the prefixal phonology of Kaqchikel provides clear 
and convincing evidence for unbounded (iterable) recursion of the 
prosodic word (w). Patterns of glottal stop insertion and degemination 
receive a simple, elegant treatment if recursion of the prosodic word is 
permitted. Theories of prosodic phonology which do without recursion are 
forced to resort to ad hoc stipulations to account for the same facts. 
Both derivational (e.g. Kiparsky 1982) and transderivational (e.g. Benua 
2000) analyses of these patterns fail on morphological grounds. The 
overall conclusion is that both abstract prosodic structure and 
recursion of the prosodic word are indispensable parts of any theory of 
word-level phonology.",1
"We propose a new analysis that unifies different relative clause constructions of Turkish for subject and object relativization. In our new analysis, we treat different participle morphemes as derivation suffixes generating noun phrases from stemmed verb phrases. This view places the whole relativization process under a noun phrase construction. By this, we  also explain away the subject on-subject asymmetry of Turkish relative clause.",0
"We argue that head movement, as an operation that builds head-adjunction structures in the syntax, has been used to model two empirically distinct classes of phenomena. One class has to do with displacement of heads (fully formed morphological words) to higher syntactic positions, and includes phenomena like verb second and verb initiality. The other class has to do with the construction of complex morphological words and is involved in various types of word formation. Based on the very different clusters of properties associated with these two classes of phenomena, we argue that they each should be accounted for by distinct grammatical operations, applying in distinct modules of the grammar, rather than by the one traditional syntactic head movement operation. We propose that the operation responsible for upward displacement of heads is genuine syntactic movement (Internal Merge) and has the properties of syntactic phrasal movement, including the ability to affect word order, the potential to give rise to interpretive effects, and the locality associated with Internal Merge. On the other hand, word formation is the result of postsyntactic amalgamation, realized as either Lowering (Embick and Noyer, 2001) or its upward counterpart, Raising. This operation, we argue, has properties that are not associated with narrow syntax: it is morphologically driven, it results in word formation, it does not exhibit interpretive effects, and it has stricter locality conditions (the Head Movement Constraint). The result is a view of head movement that not only accounts for the empirical differences between the two classes of head movement phenomena, but also lays to rest numerous perennial theoretical problems that have heretofore been associated with the syntactic head adjunction view of head movement. In addition, the framework developed here yields interesting new predictions with respect to the expected typology of head movement patterns.",1
"Person portmanteau agreement (PPA) has recently been analyzed (Georgi 2013, Woolford
2016) as involving a special type of syntactic head, distinct from the type of heads underlying
separate subject and object agreement. I provide evidence that the difference between discrete
agreement markers and PPA is best seen as superficial (morphological), and that there is no
evidence for systematic syntactic differences correlated with agreement type. The syntactic
independence of the probes can be masked in the morphology via Contextual Allomorphy
(Bobaljik 2000, Trommer 2007). Restrictions on PPA are shown to follow from independently
known conditions on Contextual Allomorphy.",0
"Language acquisition is a computational process by which language-specific experience is integrated into the learner's initial stage of knowledge. To understand language acquisition thus requires precise statements about these components and their interplay, stepping beyond the philosophical and methodological disputes in the field such as the generative vs. usage-based approaches. I review three simple equations that have guided the study of child language acquisition: How learners form and select linguistic hypotheses, and how re- searchers assess the progress of language acquisition with rigor and clarity. Furthermore, I suggest that these equations are equally applicable to second language acquisition, yielding potentially important insights on the continuities and differences between child and adult language.",0

"Modern Hebrew exhibits a non-concatenative morphology of consonantal ""roots"" and melodic ""templates"" that is typical of Semitic languages. Even though this kind of non-concatenative morphology is well known, it is only partly understood. In particular, theories differ in what counts as a morpheme: the root, the template, both, or neither. Accordingly, theories differ as to what representations learners must posit and what processes generate the eventual surface forms. In this paper I present a theory of morphology and allomorphy that combines lexical roots with syntactic functional heads, improving on previous analysis of root-and-pattern morphology. Verbal templates are here argued to emerge from the combination of syntactic elements, constrained by the general phonology of the language, rather than from some inherent difference between Semitic morphology and that of other languages. This way of generating morphological structure fleshes out a theory of morphophonological alternations that are non-adjacent on the surface but are local underlyingly; with these tools it is possible to identify where lexical exceptionality shows its effects and how it is reined in by the grammar. The Semitic root is thus analogous to lexical roots in other languages, storing idiosyncratic phonological and semantic information but obeying the syntactic structure in which it is embedded.",0
"This paper deals with the phenomenon of misplaced zu 'to' in German (with a side view of other Continental West Germanic varieties). While this phenomenon only occurs in certain configurations in the standard language, it is common in the dialects and shows quite a high degree of variability. Even though some attention has been devoted to this unexpected property of zu, previous accounts don't seem to consider or acknowledge the full range of structural types. Beside misplacings due to processes like ""upper field formation"" (cf. Bech 1955) or verb raising, the infinitival marker can also be detached to the left and even be doubled in certain contexts. I discuss two parsimonious options of how these as well as the ""regular"" cases can be analyzed, namely (a) precedence rules and (b) a special kind of infixing operation that was first proposed in the framework of Categorial Morphology (Bach 1984, Hoeksema 1985). I will show that even though the first approach has its merits (and might be worth pursuing in other theoretical contexts), the second one is more advantageous. The paper concludes with some remarks on the short-term diachrony of this construction. I argue that it constitutes the paradigm case of what Harris and Campbell (1995) call exploratory expressions.",0
"I argue that an account of both inclusive plurals (Dvorak and Sauerland 2006, Farkas and de Swart 2010, Grimm 2012, Ivlieva 2013, Krifka 1989, 1995, Mayr 2015, Lasersohn 1998, 2011, Sauerland 2003, Sauerland, Anderssen and Yatsushiro 2005, Spector 2007, Yatsushiro, Sauerland and Alexiadou 2017, Zweig 2009) and the cross-linguistic typology of grammatical number (Harbour 2014) requires the postulation of a [−atomic] feature (or something very much like it) in the structure of exclusive plural DPs. When combined with the only theory we currently have that accounts for the cross-linguistic typology of number, Harbour (2014), theories in which the exclusive plural DPs of a language with inclusive plurals are [−atomic]-less undergenerate or overgenerate with respect to that typology. These problems disappear as soon as the structure of exclusive plural DPs contains a component that generates exclusive plural interpretations, either Harbour's [−atomic] feature (added to a system with a second, [−atomic]-less structure, a proposal compatible with, e.g., Farkas and de Swart 2010), or a predicate-level exhaustivity operator (building on Mayr 2015).",0

"Given the wealth of literature on anaphora within the generative tradition, it is surprising, if not downright odd, that the question of what an anaphor formally is, still remains very much unresolved. This paper seeks to tackle this problem head on and find a fruitful resolution for it. Two main schools of thought can be discerned: one holds that anaphors are defined as being deficient for phi-features; the other, that they are deficient for some non-phi feature, F. The main source of the problem, I argue, is that there are strong theoretical and empirical arguments for both views on anaphora. Morphological underspecification, phi-matching effects, and the Anaphor Agreement Effect (AAE) provide evidence supporting a phi-deficiency approach. Perspectival anaphora, and deep-rooted anaphoric sensitivity to person-hierarchy effects reflected in PCC effects, agreement, and a seldom noticed typological gap for person in anaphoric antecedence (but see Comrie 1999), argue in favor of the other view. The upshot of all this, is that we have two mutually inconsistent but valid views on anaphora. There is no single anaphor that can satisfy the criteria for both at the same time. I thus propose that anaphors in natural language be categorized into distinct featural classes and delineate what this looks like against a binary feature system for person, enriched with a privative animacy feature. The current model is shown to make accurate empirical predictions with respect to anaphors that are insensitive to person-asymmetry effects for the PCC, to animacy effects for anaphoric agreement, and to a special case of non-ϕ-matching between the anaphor and its binder.

"In this paper, we focus on the original empirical domain of the EPP, the requirement that certain subject positions be filled, and argue that characterizing it in terms of a syntactic movement-triggering feature is misguided. Specifically, we will argue that, contrary to what is standardly assumed, the factors conditioning the EPP are actually not syntactic, but phonological, as has also been proposed by others in the literature. Nonetheless, the operations that it seems to trigger clearly are syntactic. This sheds light on why the EPP has been so difficult to get a handle on, but it also presents a conundrum, as it seems to suggest that aspects of the syntactic derivation depend on phonological information. 

Under the  broadly Minimalist framework we adopt here, this would be clearly countercyclic. In the standard Y-model and its descendants, the output of the (narrow) syntactic derivation feeds into the interpretive components of PF and LF, thus while syntactic information feeds into PF, phonological information is not available to the syntax. More recent phase-based and multiple Spell-out models introduce a certain amount of feedback, such that syntactic cycles may be interleaved with non-syntactic ones, but it is normally not assumed that phonological information from previous cycles can actually interact with later syntactic cycles. Indeed, the crucial point here is not specific to the Y-model. Rather, it extends to any framework which assumes that the syntactic derivation does not have access to the phonological properties of the structures it manipulates, e.g. as a general principle of modularity or because phonological content is explicitly inserted at a late stage of the derivation after the narrow syntax has done its work. The EPP thus seems to involve a violation of modularity or counter-cyclicity. A novel approach to the EPP is thus required, which must simultaneously be able to handle its unique properties but must also be made to fit in with the broader theory of grammatical architecture. 

We will argue that such an approach will not only allow a more satisfactory account of the EPP itself, but can also yield a unification with the comp-trace effect and yield insight into how both of these interact with pro-drop. This paper is intended as an initial contribution in this direction.",0
"Whenever two otherwise similar grammatical elements display distinct properties and appear in distinct environments, we have in principle two analytic possibilities. One is to posit that they are indeed two underlying elements with inherently distinct properties, which then lead to them having different distributions (Inherent view). The other is to posit a single underlying element with a broad distribution, with the grammatical distinctions arising from the different contexts in which that element appears (Derived view). The goal of this paper is to provide novel theoretical and empirical evidence supporting a version of the Derived view for pro vs. PRO. In particular, we will argue that OC PRO and pro are just labels for different manifestations of what is underlyingly a single underspecified nominal pro-form, which we will call UPro. Included under this UPro will also be the various types of 'non-obligatory control' (NOC) PRO, including arbitrary pro (pro_arb). The interpretive and distributional distinctions lurking behind these labels will be seen to derive from how UPro interacts with its structural environment and language-specific rules of morpho-phonological realization. Specifically, OC PRO labels a rather specific interpretation that arises in embedding contexts where a syntactic OC relationship with an antecedent can be established. Different types of pro and NOC PRO, on the other hand, involve 'control' by (typically) silent representations of discourse-contextual elements in the clausal left periphery. Finally, pro_arb arguably involves the failure to establish a referential dependence, which we will formalize in terms of a failure to Agree in the sense of Preminger (2014). The crucial evidence that motivates the Derived approach proposed here will be adduced from the ""Finiteness pro-drop Generalisation"" from Sundaresan (2014): ""For (at least a non-trivial set of) pro-drop languages with subject-verb agreement, pro-drop is disallowed in the subject position of a prototypically non-finite clause.""",0
"Modern Standard Arabic verbal agreement shows two properties that I argue to have important implications for the theory of interpretative/post-syntactic morphology. Firstly, it shows affixes whose distribution cannot be described as natural classes in the SPE-style subset principle of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993) without recourse to impoverishment rules that violate otherwise established markedness constraints (Noyer 1992, Nevins 2011). Secondly, certain affixes occur either as prefixes or as suffixes on the verb, depending on the Tense/Aspect configuration. This is unexpected from the perspective of any theory that argues that prefixhood and suffixhood are part of the vocabulary item/rule itself (Halle and Marantz 1993, Noyer 1992, Halle 2000). I argue that the hierarchy Noyer (1992) described actually captures properties of the f-seq, and that spellout operating on spans, regulated by a superset principle (Starke 2009) can capture the distribution of these affixes, and that a movement-based antisymmetry approach to linear order can derive the positional effects at PF (Kayne 1994, 2017, Koopman 2017b, 2018, Julien 2002, Blix under review) in a way that unifies their paradigmatic distribution with their linear one.",0
"The interaction of numerals and number-marking has generated much research in both morphosyntax and semantics in those domains. In this paper, I propose an analysis of number-marking in the numeral-noun constructions of Estonian. They are noteworthy for the existence of two morphosyntactic frames. In one, both the numeral and noun are singular, and the noun bears partitive case. In the other, both the numeral and noun are plural, and there is no assignment of partitive case. I propose an analysis whereby the head assigning partitive case is of the same syntactic category as the head introducing plurality: Borer's (2005) Div. Previous accounts do not capture the generalization that the numeral always matches the noun's number-marking. I propose it is another instance of the language's already robust system of nominal concord.",0
"There exists a general restriction on admissible functional sequences which prevents adjacent identical heads. We investigate a particular instantiation of this restriction in the domain of negation. Empirically, it manifests itself as a restriction on the stacking of multiple negative morphemes. We propose a principled account of this restriction in terms of the general ban on immediately consecutive identical heads in the functional sequence on the one hand, and the presence of a Neg feature inside negative morphemes on the other hand. The account predicts that the stacking of multiple negative morphemes should be possible provided they are separated by intervening levels of structure. We show that this prediction is borne out.",0
"Antonymic pairs of gradable adjectives (e.g. tall-short) give rise to contrary opposition. This fact has so far stood in the way of reducing this type of opposition to logical negation, which gives rise to contradictory opposition. We present an analysis of these antonymic pairs in terms of an underlying logical negation, and propose to derive the contrary nature of the opposition from the interaction of interval semantics with the presence of a contextual standard, which is known to be a part of the denotation of gradable adjectives. This analysis opens the way for a decomposition of negative adjectives as containing a logical negation with contradictory meaning.",0
"It is standardly assumed that nominals in the languages of the world are syntactically complex in the typical case, being made up of not just NP, but one or more functional projections, e.g., DP (Abney, 1987). Recently, this assumption has been questioned, especially for languages without articles (Bošković (2005), et seq.). The alternative proposal holds that nominals in Serbo-Croatian (and more strongly, languages without articles in general) lack the DP projection, and that this difference has a variety of syntactic consequences. In this paper, I investigate the nominal extended projection of another language without articles, Estonian (Finno-Ugric). On the basis of a number of facts about Estonian's system of adnominal genitives, I conclude that nominals in Estonian should not be given the same analysis as those in Serbo-Croatian. I propose instead that Estonian's nominals are DPs. I then propose that indefinite pronouns and wh-determiners instantiate the category D in the language, arguing that DP does more cross-linguistically than host articles. I conclude that nominal structure in languages without articles can be just as complex as nominal structure in languages with articles.

"The mapping of syntactic structure onto PF at spell-out is affected by two features, w and @. W partitions a span (a head-complement sequence) into insertion spans, which are relevant for cyclic lexical insertion and the creation of prosodic words. @ determines the linearization of words in the span, with respect to phrasal adjuncts and specifiers. Clitics and incorporated elements are defective specifiers, lacking @ and hence incapable of linearizing independently. This theory replaces the X^0 theory of word formation and linearization. X^0 theory is crucially reliant on head movement, which this proposal attempts to eliminate.",1

"In any language, some phonotactic constraints can be stated without reference to morphology, but many of the more nuanced phonotactic generalizations do make use of morphosyntactic and lexical information. At the most basic level, many languages mark edges of words in some phonological way. Different phonotactic constraints hold of sounds that belong to the same morpheme as opposed to sounds that are separated by a morpheme boundary. Different phonotactic constraints may apply to morphemes of different types (such as roots versus affixes). There are also correlations between phonotactic shapes and following certain morphosyntactic and phonological rules, which may correlate to syntactic category, declension class, or etymological origins. The article reviews approaches to the interaction between phonotactics and morphology, focusing on two questions: (1) how to account for rules that are sensitive to morpheme boundaries and structure and (2) what is the status of phonotactic constraints associated with only some morphemes.",0

"In this work we investigate the internal syntax and semantics of quantifier phrases (QP) involving cardinal numerals. Concentrating on a set of previously documented puzzles concerning Case and number agreement within the numeral phrase in Russian, we argue that these agreement patterns follow naturally if one recognizes three structural layers in a numeral-based QP: the countability layer, the number layer and the quantificational layer. Our central theoretical claim is that the countability layer is implemented as a (pseudo-)classifier structure whose morphological manifestation obeys a principle of syntactic 'visibility'. Our specific claim for Russian is that, diachronically, this countability layer has emerged as a result of the loss of the dual number in the course of transition between Old and Modern Russian. We strengthen our conclusions with psycholinguistic evidence from a sentence completion study that tests Russian speakers' sensitivity to the countability layer.",0
"This paper examines how roots are adjectivised within a featural system comprising only two categories. It argues that adjectivisers do not exist, leaving the repertory of categorisers with two members only: verbalisers, v heads, and nominalisers, n heads. We proceed to argue that the adjective category is possibly universal insofar as it involves prima facie dual categorisation: adjectives obtain when a root combines with a complex categorial structure involving both a verbaliser and nominaliser. This proposal is supported by grammar-internal evidence (viz. their external modification by adverbs and the nominal character of their internal structure) and by broader typological facts (the distribution of which, categorially, follows from our analysis). Several consequences and predictions are beneficially derived.",1
"Suppletion for case and number in pronominal paradigms shows robust patterns across a large, cross-linguistic survey. These patterns are largely, but not entirely, parallel to patterns described in Bobaljik (2012) for suppletion for adjectival degree. Like adjectival degree suppletion along the dimension positive < comparative < superlative, if some element undergoes suppletion for a category X, that element will also undergo suppletion for any category more marked than X on  independently established markedness hierarchies for case and number. We argue that the structural account of adjectival suppletive patterns in Bobaljik (2012) extends to pronominal suppletion, on the assumption that case (Caha 2009) and number (Harbour 2011) hierarchies are structurally encoded. In the course of the investigation, we provide evidence against the common view that suppletion obeys a condition of structural (Bobaljik 2012) and/or linear (Embick 2010) adjacency, and argue that the full range of facts requires instead a domain-based approach to locality (cf. Moskal 2015). In the realm of number, suppletion of pronouns behaves as expected, but a handful of examples for suppletion in nouns show a pattern that is initially unexpected; however which is consistent with the overall view if the Number head is also internally structurally complex (contra Harbour 2007). Moreover, variation in suppletive patterns for number converges with independent evidence for variation in the internal complexity and markedness.",0
"The state of the art of the debate between externalist and internalist concepts of language is reviewed in this paper, and a new conceptualization of language as a ""developmental hybrid"" is suggested that entails that it equally comprises environmental and organism-internal component pieces, in an ultimately non dissociable way. The key for understanding this hybrid status is to be found in development, for when individually evolving, a general dynamic is observed in which organism-internal facilities selectively apply to certain designated aspects of the environmental stimulus, which in their turn have a facilitatory impact on these very same facilities. These kinds of loops inspire the conclusion that the internal and the external compose a single, integrated developmental unit.",0
"Besides total vowel harmony and nasal harmony, Fròʔò, a Gur language spoken in Côte d'Ivoire, has a pervasive consonantal agreement in its nominal domain: the morphologically 'dependent morphemes' (in terms of concord, Corbett 1991) or 'associate morphemes' (Hockett 1958), of nominal heads, agree in their articulator and [±continuant] features, a special case of alliterative concord, because the head noun is playing no role in the alliteration. Besides the consonantal agreement features, these free associate morphemes have their own vocalic features and their own [±voice] feature. The paper starts with a review of nominal classes in Fròʔò and the morphological structure of simple nouns. It is proposed that Fròʔò has a partly non-concatenative morphology and that a standard Distributed Morphology analysis cannot fully account for the phonology of the resulting morphemes. In the second part, the role of phonology is investigated. It is proposed that well-formed morphemes are the result of partial or deficient phonological specifications in need of repair. The phonological approach is couched in an optimality-theoretic framework (see Saba Kirchner 2010 and Bye & Svenonius 2012 among others for similar proposals). Part of the final specification of these morphemes are due to phonological repairs elicited by markedness and faithfulness constraints, and the filling in of features due to vowel and nasal harmony, as well as consonant epenthesis.",0
"The first aim of this squib is to show that, under the correct syntactic configuration, volere 'want' can be embedded in Italian faire-infinitives (FI), contrary to previous claims. Secondly, we show that want-FIs exhibit peculiar properties: (i) they disallow a full DP causee; (ii) they permit intermediate cliticisation onto
volere; (iii) they allow optional splitting of clitic clusters; and (iv) they marginally permit an accusative causee in transitive contexts where the object is a clitic. We attribute these effects to defective intervention which bans a full DP causee and requires the creation of a biclausal ECM construction, where accusative is exceptionally licensed, and where the selection of a silent OBTAIN by 'want' creates an additional clitic position.",0
"This paper outlines some of the main phonological and morphological features that Moroccan Arabic has developed in contact with Amazigh. Based on previous work, it is argued that Moroccan Arabic has lost the Classical Arabic short vowels and has developed a short central vowel, used break up illicit consonant clusters. It is shown that the distribution of this schwa-like vowel is better analysed within a strict CV model where ungoverned empty vocalic positions surface at the phonetic level. In the same vein, it is proposed that the Classical Arabic short [u] is kept in Moroccan Arabic as a labial feature when it occurs in the vicinity of a labial, velar or uvular consonant. Sibilant harmony is another feature that Moroccan Arabic shares with Amazigh. It is analysed as a long distance process which occurs within a specific domain, consisting of the stem template, plus an empty initial CV. This empty site allows for the Moroccan Arabic definite article and the Amazigh causative prefix to harmonize with the stem sibilant. The influence of Amazigh on Moroccan Arabic is also visible at the morphological level. We discuss the behaviour of the circumfix /ta…-t/, which Moroccan Arabic borrowed as an unanalysed complex, used to form abstract and profession nouns.",0
This book presents a morphosyntactic account of vowel length in Contemporary Czech. The present approach is strictly decompositional on both the phonological and the morphosyntactic side. It assumes prosodic affixes in contemporary Czech. The focus is on prosodic affixes which realize morphosyntactic parts of diminutives and hypocoristics.,0
"Since Cheng and Sybesma (1999), there has been much discussion of how the interaction of functional heads in the extended nominal projection in numeral classifier languages gives rise to a definite interpretation. An important observation that came out of this discussion is that there appears to be some kind of interaction between a classifier head (call it Cl) and definiteness, where either Cl and D interact through head movement (Simpson 2005), or the Cl head itself introduces an iota-operator. Cheng and Sybesma note that in Cantonese, which exhibits bare Cl-N sequences with a definite interpretation, the addition of a numeral has the effect of ""undoing the definiteness"". The standard approach to accounting for this blocking of definiteness is that of Simpson (2005), where it is suggested that for a definite interpretation to arise in classifier languages, the Cl head has to move to D (in the spirit of Longobardi 1994). The blocking of a definite interpretation in Cantonese is the result of a Head Movement Constraint violation; Cl cannot move to D over the numeral. I show that this numeral blocking effect extends to other languages too, and I argue based on data from those languages that a Head Movement Constraint-based account of definiteness in classifier languages cannot capture the facts, and that we require an alternative. I put forward a proposal which has the consequence that the classifier and numeral form a constituent to the exclusion of the noun, and then discuss some suggestive evidence in favour of such a structural configuration.",0
"In the principle and parameter theory of generative grammar in the 1980s, the variation of word order in languages was ascribed to the value of the head directionality parameter (head-initial/final). Following the minimalist program of linguistic theory, this paper argues that syntactic computation builds a structure without linear order, which is only linearized at the externalization to the sensory-motor system, according to the stress pattern of the language. We can derive word order variation in the world's languages from their phonology, especially their stress systems. We can do away with the complement movement that derives head-final structure from the head-initial structure constructed by the Linear Correspondence Axiom (Kayne (1993)).",0
"This paper examines multidimensional paradigms, i.e. paradigms involving more than one feature dimension. I examine the concrete case of pronominal paradigms, which involve (at least) the dimensions of person and number. The problem that arises in such paradigms is that syncretisms may be observed in each dimension, i.e. they may occur both vertically (cross-person) and horizontally (cross-number). While classical nanosyntax embodies a theory of syncretism that can account for one dimension, it requires an extension to account for syncretisms in the other dimension(s). I discuss two such extensions, one making use of pointers (Caha & Pantcheva 2012), and another in terms of a revision of the Superset Principle (based on Caha2014). I show that both approaches make subtly different empirical predictions. Most notably, the approach in terms of pointers is able to derive certain ABA-syncretisms. This consideration favors the approach in terms of the revised Superset Principle. On the other hand, the revised Superset Principle faces an empirical problem in the derivation of horizontal (cross-number) syncretism, which requires the introduction of a principle to determine a winner between candidates that are in a tie with respect to the Elsewhere Principle.",0
"This paper offers an in-depth look at roots and verb stem morphology in Chuj (Mayan)
in order to address a larger question: when it comes to the formation of verb stems, what
information is contributed by the root, and what is contributed by the functional heads? I
show first that roots in Chuj are not acategorical, but must be grouped into classes based
on their stem-forming possibilities. Root category does not map directly to surface lexical
category, but does determine which functional heads (i.e. valence morphology) may merge
with the root. Second, I show that while the introduction of the external argument, along
with clausal licensing and agreement generally, are all governed by higher functional
heads, the presence or absence of an internal argument is dictated by the root. Specifically,
I show that transitive roots in Chuj always combine with an internal argument, whether
it be (i) a full DP, (ii) a bare pseudo-incorporated NP, or (iii) an implicit object in an
antipassive. This work contributes to the discussion of how valence morphology operates:
in the spirit of works such as Alexiadou, Anagnostopoulou & Sch¨afer 2006, I argue that
valence morphology applies directly to roots, rather than to some ""inherent valence"" of a
verb.",0
"The question of whether linguistic knowledge is binary or stochastic is one of the most important questions in general linguistic inquiry. Much recent work in the last few decades shows that phonological knowledge is stochastic (e.g. Hayes & Londe 2006). Building on this body of research, we show that in Japanese, gradient phonological knowledge affects several word formation patterns in stochastic ways. Concretely, we show that identity avoidance effects hold at both the segmental and the CV-moraic levels. These identity avoidance effects stochastically affect two types of word formation patterns in Japanese: group name formation and rendaku. We show that Maximum Entropy Grammar (Goldwater & Johnson 2003), together with multiple OCP constraints (Coetzee & Pater 2008), successfully models both of the observed morphological word formation patterns, without any further stipulation. In addition to this theoretical contribution, one of the patterns discussed in this paper-group name formation-has not been analyzed from the perspective of formal phonological theories before, and hence this paper has descriptive novelty as well.",0
"Nevins (2011) proposes that dual-plural number contrasts are Impoverished in the context of feminine gender in Ljubljana Slovenian. However, in some Case-forms of nominal paradigms, Impoverishment is blocked. This pattern can be given a principled account if Impoverishment is strictly local, implying it may only search for its triggering context in the closest head in the c-command domain. The absence of a local trigger gives rise to Intervention.",0
"In this paper, a syntactic account of Italian clitics is presented. It is suggested that clitics in Italian are different from other major Romance languages because of their specification for two pervasive syntactic features, namely [π] and [ω]. All clitics but ne carry the feature [π], whereas the feature [ω] is present in third person accusative-specified clitics as well as past participles. Due to the feature [π], simple clitics must undergo an unusual long outbound movement under OCP. However, the most remarkable combined effect of these feature is to be found in clusters of object clitics, which must be processed by a compounding rule (CCR), and then licensed by a phonological sandhi rule (ICIS), in order to avoid an overload derivation (DEN>3). The feature [ω] has a further effect in the grammar: it forces the agreement of past participles and direct object clitics. Various cooccurrence restrictions, traditionally considered to be arbitrary or idiosyncratic, are accounted for with simplicity and elegance.",0
"One prominent theory capturing unexpected phonological similarity across morphologically-related forms is Output-Output Correspondence (OO-Corr – Benua 1997; Burzio 1998; a.o.). Classic OO-Corr involves correspondence between an output [X-Y] and a subconstituent base [X], e.g. a derived stem with a bare root [√-DERIV]x ↔ [√]x (párent-hood ↔ párent). Further, Paradigmatic OO-Corr (Pa-OO-C) involves correspondence between an output [X-A] and a base [X-B], where the affixes [A] and [B] share a morphosyntactic feature [+F] which places them together in a morphological paradigm (McCarthy 2005, Hall & Scott 2007), e.g. [√-INFL[1SG PAST]]x ↔ [√-INFL[1SG PRES]]x. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel type of OO-Corr termed Transparadigmatic Output-Output Correspondence (Tr-OO-C), involving correspondence between an output [X-Y-Z] and a base [X-Z]. Under Tr-OO-C, morphologically-related forms share the same root as well as share the same outer morphology, but differ in terms of an inner morphology, e.g. [√-DERIV-INFL]x ↔ [√-INFL]x. I argue that Ese Ejja (Takanan: Bolivia) is an example of Tr-OO-C, wherein there is unexpected stress uniformity between inflectional and derivational verbal forms. I argue that derivational forms are in correspondence with an inflectional base enforced by highly ranked constraints ID-BO(STRESS), CORR-BO(ROOT), and CORR-BO(INFL), modeled after Agreement-By-Correspondence (Rose & Walker 2004). In total, Ese Ejja prosody is a crucial case study for OO-C and adds to the body of evidence showing how the phonology of words can be shaped by morphologically-related forms.",1
"Grammatical gender features, which are seen as having both a semantic and arbitrary form, have been argued to embody the interpretable-uninterpretable distinction: semantic gender is interpretable, and arbitrary gender is uninterpretable (Kramer 2014, 2015). Using French as a case study, this paper argues that all gender features-even those which have been seen as arbitrary-are necessarily interpretable at the LF interface. Even if a feature does not contribute compositionally to the meaning of a structure, it must be visible to provide the context for interpretation. This leads to an argument for the abandonment of the interpretable-uninterpretable distinction in the representation of features. Instead, the analysis contends that the mechanism of interpretation is responsible for differences in the semantic contribution of features: both heads and sub-structures can be taken as input to the interpretive mechanism. The interpretation of heads leads to compositional meaning, and the interpretation of sub-structures to non-compositional meaning. The system has the consequence of simplifying restrictions on gender specification such that they are solely linked to the availability of a semantic interpretation, rather than to a combination of phonological and semantic licensing conditions.",0

"The present work defends the idea that grammatical categories are not intrinsic to mergeable items, taking as a departure point Lenneberg's (1967, 1975) claim that syntactic objects are definable only contextually. It is argued that there are four different strands of inquiry that are of interest when one seeks to build an evolutionarily plausible theory of labels and operation Label: (i) linguistic constraints on adjacent elements of the same type such as Repetition/Identity Avoidance ([*XX]), (ii) data that flout these constraints ([XX]), (iii) disorders that raise questions as to whether the locus of impairment is a categorial feature per se, and (iv) operation Label as a candidate for human uniqueness. After discussing categorial identity through these perspectives, this work first traces the origins and manifestations of Identity Avoidance in language and other domains of human cognition, with emphasis on attention orienting. Second, it proposes a new processing principle, the Novel Information Bias, that (i) captures linguistic Identity Avoidance based on how the brain decodes types and tokens and (ii) explains the universal fact that generally the existence of adjacent occurrences of syntactically and/or phonologically identical tokens is severely constrained.",0
"This dissertation investigates the nature of the Philippine-type voice system and two associated diachronic questions: (i) what is the nature of noun-verb (nominalizer-voice affix) homophony, a common trait of Philippine-type languages?, and (ii) does the synchronic variation of this voice system among higher-order Austronesian languages constitute valid evidence for Austronesian primary-level subgrouping? Using novel comparative data from Puyuma, Amis, Seediq, and Tagalog as the empirical starting point, I explore the shared syntax of Philippine-type languages and its implications for these two questions.

In the first half of the study, I argue that Philippine-type languages are best analyzed as exhibiting a nominative-accusative case system with prominent topic-marking that overrides morphological case. I then provide a novel account for the nature of the four-way division of the Philippine-type voice morphology: the four affixes are best analyzed as the spell-out of four different bundles of Agree relations that agree with the topic of a clause. Under this analysis, Philippine-type ""voice"" is fundamentally different from Indo-European ""voice"". The latter is valency-rearranging morphology, while the former is topic-indicating morphology. Building on this analysis, I argue that Philippine-type languages are best characterized as discourse configurational languages (Li & Thompson 1976; Kiss 1995; Miyagawa 2010, 2017), whose topic-prominent nature is manifested both in prominent topic-marking and in articulated verbal morphology that indicates the Agree relations of the topic in a clause. I conclude that Philippine-type languages are best analyzed as hosting a topic-feature on C and the φ-feature on T, with topic-agreement spelled-out as verbal morphology.

In the second half of the study, I demonstrate how this synchronic syntactic analysis enables a simpler solution to two central issues in Austronesian diachronic linguistics (i)-(ii). Building on the conclusions outlined above, I argue that neither the presence of nominalizer-voice affix homophony nor that of Philippine-type voice distinctions in root clauses constitutes valid evidence for Austronesian primary-level subgrouping, as the absence of both features reflects independent morphological erosions in innovative languages. I conclude that phonological innovations are better evidence for Austronesian primary-level subgrouping than the morphosyntactic variation among higher-order Philippine-type languages, as the latter is best viewed as a product of independent drifts, rather than shared innovations.",1

"This paper investigates properties of a class of determiners which can be loosely labelled specific in that their distribution falls in between maximally-quantifying definite determiners and indefinites which only contribute existential quantification. Based on a sample which includes data from Buryat, Komi, Mari, Mordvin, and Turkish, I propose that suffixal determiners form a semantically natural class in that their distribution can be modelled by means of a relational component in the semantics of the determiners which relates the denotation of the noun to an antecedent. I derive the observed distributional differences between languages from the range of values available for the interpretation of this component. In particular, whether a relation of identity falls within the range of values has consequences for whether a suffixal determiner triggers existence presupposition, which, in turn, has consequences both for the interpretation of the DP in question and for the inter-paradigm competition in a language.",0
"Recent research on verbal doubling across languages (Nunes 2004, Martins 2007, Kandybowicz 2009, Biberauer 2009, among others) show that this phenomenon is a fruitful domain of inquiry, especially, regarding the nature of copying phenomena and the way in which such phenomena interact with syntax and morphology. In line with the aforementioned works, I focus on the empirical domain of verbal doubling in Spanish and European Portuguese and argue that not all verbal doubling structures must be derived as the result of syntactic copying. In particular, new evidence is discussed in order to show that predicate fronting in Spanish does not result from movement (pace Vicente 2007, 2009).  Other varieties of verbal duplication, such as non-local doublings in Rioplatense Spanish and Italian, and local doublings in European Portuguese, are instead the direct result of verbal copy pronunciation arising from complex factors involving the structure of remnant movement and the general conditions that regulate copy pronunciation in syntax and morphology. These particular varieties of verbal duplications in Romance allow us to decide among different theories of copy realization in competition.",0
"This paper examines the morphological expression of dual and plural number in languages with apparent singular-dual-plural number systems and shows that the observed markedness of number features prevents them from accounting for all attested morphological patterns. I use the number systems of Slovenian, Manam and Mi'gmaq as examples for the three attested patterns I identify. I extend Nevins's (2011a) system of feature markedness to account for the Slovenian and Mi'gmaq patterns. I motivate a non-featural analysis of the Manam dual and compare its behaviour to that of non-inflectional plurals (Wiltschko 2008, Butler 2012).",1
"This paper offers a description of the nominal class system in Esahie (Central-Tano, Kwa, Niger-Congo). It contends that, though the noun class system of Esahie per se is morpho-syntactically vestigial, hence differing from other African languages (e.g. most Bantu languages) where noun classes can be assimilated with GENDER, in Esahie, NUMBER, as a syntactic feature, triggers agreement, rendering the class system in Esahie a number-based one. On morpho-syntactic grounds, six distinctive noun form classes are established for Esahie. 

This paper also provides an account of how morpho-phonological information influences the noun form classes of Esahie. As argued for Akan (cf. Bodomo and Marfo 2006), morpho-phonological information is equally relevant for understanding the choice of one number affix over the other in Esahie. The present work presents yet another piece of evidence in support of the view (cf. Ameka and Dakubu 2008, Aboh and Essegbey 2010, and Güldemann and Fiedler 2017) that unlike the Ghana-TogoMountain languages, which have been attested to have a functional class system, the Central-Tano languages, to which Esahie pertains, have a relatively fairly decayed and less-conservative inflectional system. 

Comparing Esahie to Akan, however, data discussed in this paper seems to suggest, prima facie, that Esahie has suffered a relatively stronger deal of morpho-syntactic decay in the inflectional system of the nominal domain. Data used in this work is collected largely through elicitation from native speakers.",1
"In Moroccan Arabic, morphologically-derived causatives are uniformly formed through the affixation of a consonantal mora in an infixed position. Two accounts have been proposed: the templatic-based account whereby consonant gemination results from a fixed-shape template and the analysis contending that causative gemination succumbs to positional faithfulness effects. In this paper, we diverge from this trend, claiming that the two approaches suffer from a lack of empirical adequacy. As an alternative, we propose an analysis within the theory of Optimality Theory, with the basic assumption being that the linearization of the causative morpheme is instead the result of phonological well-formedness interacting with the morphological process of causativization. An important empirical prediction of our analysis is that the causative affix can neither move to word-initial positions nor word-final positions under the pressure of phonological well-formedness constraints. This is shown to be an example of the Emergence of the Unmarked, wherein the otherwise inactive markedness constraint *COMPLEXONSET in the language bears the burden of the explanation. The strength of the analysis suggested herein resides in the treatment of the infixal process as resulting from simple and universal constraints, primarily achieved through well-motivated demands on prosodic well-formedness without reference to language-particular templatic constraints.",1
"The traditional notion of case is too coarse to distinguish between the English prepositional dative and the English shifted dative, the Spanish bare accusative and the Spanish ""a"" accusative, etc. I show that refining our typology of case to include such distinctions resolves a *ABA counterexample to Caha's 2009 case hierarchy and I discuss where these new distinctions should be placed in the underlying representation of case.",0
"Frankenduals, that is, duals composed (as in Hopi) of a nonsingular and a nonplural morpheme, display a consistent asymmetry. The first typological study of its kind shows that the element closer to the nominal is sensitive to (non)singularity, whereas the one sensitive to (non)plurality is more peripheral. This pattern impacts on morphology (dual featurally crosscuts singular and plural), morphosemantics (number features are sensitive to order of composition), and syntax and its interfaces (the features are interpreted and pronounced where they are merged). The resulting account builds on Hale's (1986) idea that features are semantically broad, ontologically flexible, and category independent.",1

"The questions posed and addressed in this dissertation are broadly questions regarding the nature cross-linguistic variation and why languages differ from one another in these particular ways. This thesis focuses on four known points of cross-linguistic variation in the verbal domain: tense, aspect, finiteness and the perfect. It uses data primarily from the Dravidian language Malayalam to explore these questions.
Past work on tense and aspect in Dravidian languages (Amritavalli & Jayaseelan 2005) has claimed that Malayalam, along with the other Dravidian languages, is tenseless. This dissertation, however, shows that Malayalam is empirically different from other tenseless languages and that it does have morphology that encodes tense semantics and a TP. It further examines what have previously been called the two 'imperfectives' and argues that the first one is a type of progressive. The second form, is shown to be something between an interative and an imperfective. While the dissertation argues that Malayalam, has tense morphology and a TP, it argues that Malayalam lacks perfect morphology and a PerfP in, minimally, Universal perfects.
The investigation of finiteness focuses on the empirical facts regarding the different non-finite forms in Malayalam and the theoretical implications of these facts. It points out a problem for classifying negation as 'finite' versus 'non-finite', as has frequently been done (Amritavalli & Jayaseelan 2005, a.o.) and argues that non- finite uses of the -uka marker are progressive participles, that Conjunctive Participles are best analyzed as Stump (1985)-style absolutives and that -athu gerunds involve nominalization above the TP-level (cf. Borsley & Kornfilt 2000, Baker 2011).",0
"This paper discusses reduplication as a technique of word formation in German within the framework of Optimality Theory. In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed taxonomy identifies rhyme and ablaut reduplication as the only productive, truly reduplicative processes in the morphology of German. All other contemplable cases of reduplicative structures are properly treated as either phonological doubling, lexical sequencing or (special cases of) compounding. An OT analysis is offered which suggests that both rhyme and ablaut reduplication may emerge when a segmentally and prosodically unspecified expressive morpheme is attached to a base - given that the base strictly obeys certain word prosodic requirements.
The present approach eschews constraints that make explicit reference to base-reduplicant correspondence. The OT grammar successfully models the emergence of the fixed bipedal structure, the obligatory segmental deviance of the reduplicant, non-exponence of the expressive morpheme in the case of non-trochaic bases, the variable linearization of base and reduplicant in ablaut reduplication, and the interaction of reduplication with i) segmental alternations and ii) onset complexity.
Certain (cross-linguistic) correlations regarding constraints on reduplicative word formation and poetic devices, such as rhyme and meter, are discussed.",0
"In this squib, we provide evidence that finite control languages like Greek and Romanian display Partial Control (PC), albeit in very limited contexts, contrary to what has previously been claimed in the literature. This fact poses problems for existing theories of control which predict a fundamental incompatibility between PC and [+Agr] complements. These finding can be considered welcome, however, inasmuch as the ban on PC in [+Agr] contexts appears stipulative in the context of Landau's (2015) approach. They are also consistent with the claim that European Portuguese inflected infinitives, which are also [+Agr] also permit obligatory control (Sheehan, 2018, to appear).",0
"This paper examines the nature of the dependency between the availability of null subjects and the ``richness'' of verbal subject agreement, known as Taraldsen's Generalisation (Taraldsen 1980, Rizzi 1986, Adams:1987), from the point of view of grammar change in Medieval French based on corpus data. We present a corpus-based quantitative model of the syncretisation of verbal subject agreement spanning the whole Medieval French period and evaluate two hypotheses relating agreement and null subjects: one relating the two as reflexes of the same grammatical property and a variational learning-based hypothesis whereby syncretic endings create a learning bias against the null subject grammar. We show that only the latter approach has the potential to reconcile the intuition behind Taraldsen's Generalisation with the fact that it has proven non-trivial to formulate the notion of agreement richness in a way which would unequivocally predict whether a language has null subjects.",0
"In this paper I examine patterns of irregular allomorphy in nominal stems sensitive to case in a number of nominative-accusative languages. I will argue that the data surveyed reveal a certain regularity in the distribution of irregularity across the cases in that they conform to what I call the Nominative Stem-Allomorphy Generalization. One irregular stem form is always found in the nominative (and in other cases that may be systematically syncretic with it), with all other cases sharing a single other stem form. I will show that this subsumes a clear instance of a *ABA pattern, and in fact is even more restrictive, as it also shows *ABC and (qualified) *AAB. I will situate these findings relative to recent work on *ABA patterns and on case-sensitive irregularity in noun and pronoun suppletion, and then will build on that prior work to propose an account for the generalization in terms of a structured representation of nouns and case categories interacting with locality conditions on allomorphy.",0
"The purpose of this paper is threefold: to survey current work in Stratal Phonology, to respond to recent arguments against cyclic phonological derivations, and to explore the morphological implications of the theory.

	Section 2 lays out the basic principles of Stratal Phonology: cyclicity and stratification. These make major empirical predictions, including Cyclic Containment, the Russian Doll Theorem, and Chung's Generalization. The exposition highlights the fact that Stratal Phonology differs from other cyclic frameworks, such as Cophonology Theory, in positing relatively fewer cycles. Recent proposals are reviewed which look to independent facts in an effort to derive long-standing generalizations about cyclic domain structures: notably, the noncyclic status of roots and the recursiveness of stem-level domains.

	Section 3 addresses the contest between cyclicity and output-output correspondence, focusing on Steriade's (1999) claim that English dual-level affixes like _-able_ challenge Cyclic Containment. I argue that, whilst Steriade's argument draws force from important empirical facts, containment-compliant analyses centred on lexical acquisition not only describe the phenomena accurately, but also generate correct empirical predictions that are not matched by accounts relying on output-output correspondence.

	Section 4 assesses Stratal Phonology by evaluating the plausibility of its implications for morphology. I show, first, that the theory can derive the relative ordering of phonological strata without recourse to the Affix Ordering Generalization, and that it can handle bracketing paradoxes without recourse to rebracketing operations. At the same time, Stratal Phonology presupposes that morphology and phonology are distinct grammatical modules, and for this reason it favours concatenativist approaches to putative instances of process morphology, in line with Generalized Nonlinear Affixation.",1
"Metaphony in Romance poses a well-known problem for Element Theory, as it seems to involve lowering. D'Alessandro and van Oostendorp (2016) propose to solve this by assuming some suffixes are '|A| Eaters', absorbing the |A| element from the stem vowel without getting phonetically realized themselves. This paper points to some problems with this analysis, and shows that Magnetic Grammar, a framework in all linguistic variation is encoded in features, might help to solve them.

"In Cypriot Greek, the negated future is marked by an element, tha, which appears instead of the expected present tense copula and a selected subordinating element. This paper documents the distribution of this item for the first time, and presents an analysis in Distributed Morphology that analyzes tha as a portmanteau morpheme realizing two heads in the context of negation. This analysis requires that spans (or targets of Fusion) can include a verb and the head of its C complement.",0
"Ergative languages such as Niuean and languages with Austronesian-type voice morphology such as Tagalog show overt transitivity alternations based on not only the presence of an external argument but also the properties of the internal argument. In this paper, I propose that case assignment and overt voice alternations in these languages are different reflexes of the same interaction between the lexical features of Voice and the distribution of valued phi-features in the syntax. The result is an expanded system of Voice, varying along two dimensions: (i) external argument introduction, which is lexically specified on Voice, and (ii) the presence of a valued phi-feature, which is derived on Voice through feature sharing with lower verbal functional heads. The analysis presented for simple transitives in Austronesian-type voice languages is extended to account for productive causatives in Austronesian, which are proposed to involve Voice over Voice, as well as voice morphology in nominative-accusative languages such as Japanese.",1
"This paper discusses the current understanding of what has been called NOMINAL CONCORD, whereby modifiers of a noun match certain features of the noun (e.g., gender, number, or case features). Part I discusses existing understanding of concord, remaining as descriptive as possible. Concord has been argued to involve gender, number, case, and definiteness, and nearly every word class that can be present inside nominal phrases is capable of showing concord. I consider some questions concerning the typology of concord, which is largely uncharted territory. Part II focuses on existing formal analyses of concord. Analyses of φ-feature concord are rather varied, but analyses of case concord more or less converge on the same mechanism. Finally, I consider the insight offered by analyses of cases of mixed concord, where modifiers do not all match each other or the head noun in features or feature values.

"This paper focuses on overt impersonal pronouns such as English 'one' and Dutch 'men' in eight Germanic languages (English, Frisian, Icelandic, Danish, Dutch, German, Norwegian and Swedish). Cinque (1988), Egerland (2003), a.o, assumed that there are two types of impersonal pronouns, one type that can occur in multiple syntactic positions but can only have a generic reading and a type that can have generic and existential readings but can only occur as an external argument. I show based on novel data from ECM constructions and passives and unaccusatives, that it is not the syntactic position which restricts the distribution of men-type pronouns, but it is case. English type pronouns can occur with multiple cases, but can only have a generic inclusive reading. All Dutch type pronouns can only occur with nominative case and can have multiple impersonal readings. Moreover, I show that Dutch and Swedish allow an existential reading when the pronoun is a derived subject (contra Cinque (1988), Egerland (2003)) I will account for this correlation between the different readings and case by assuming different feature make-ups for the pronouns, following Egerland (2003), Hoekstra (2010), Ackema and Neeleman (2016): 'one' has phi features and therefore always needs to be obligatorily inclusive; 'men' lacks this functional layer too and therefore has no restriction on its readings. Moreover, I propose that since men lacks a phi-layer, it is too deficient to project a KP, and therefore it can only occur with unmarked nominative case.",0
"This paper provides novel evidence that ellipsis can target bound morphemes. The evidence comes from suspended affixation of case markers in alternative questions in Digor and Iron Ossetic. The current literature on alternative questions (e.g. Does Mary like coffee or tea?) proposes that in many languages they are derived by disjunction of and ellipsis in constituents as large as a vP or even as a CP. Language-specific evidence in favor of such structure of alternative questions is available for Ossetic as well. Accordingly, the ostensible disjuncts coffee or tea do not actually form a constituent and case must be separately assigned to each of the DPs. Therefore, a case suffix shared under suspended affixation cannot attach to the orP as a whole. A deletion-based analysis can successfully derive the properties of suspended affixation in Ossetic alternative questions. I advance a specific proposal that incorporates ellipsis into the Distributed Morphology derivation.",1
"This paper discusses the locus of grammatical gender and semantic gender features. It looks into the gender of pronominals and into cases of mismatch between grammatical and semantic gender in Brazilian Portuguese and Greek. The conclusion is that grammatical gender is encoded on n, while natural gender on a higher functional head -- harking back to Picallo (1991) and much subsequent work.",0
"Indefinite and possessive pronouns in German such as 'ein-es' (`one') and 'mein-er' (`mine') differ from their determiner counterparts in that they bear strong inflectional endings. Following Saab & Liptak (2016), I argue that this difference in inflection is due to NP ellipsis, which creates a 'stranded' affix that subsequently docks onto the determiner. Assuming that adjectives are re-attached by Local Dislocation allows us to account for the descriptive observation that the determiner and pronominal paradigms differ only in the same three exceptional cases where determiners do not bear overt inflection. Furthermore, I discuss how this approach can extend to similar data from Afrikaans, Dutch and English, as well as to split topicalization constructions in German. This analysis provides further support for Saab & Liptak's proposal that inflection emerges as a direct result of ellipsis, rather than constituting part of the licensing conditions on ellipsis (Lobeck 1995).",0
"This paper investigates the syntactic properties of deponents in finite and non-finite contexts in several Indo-European languages (Vedic Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, Latin, Hittite, Modern Greek) and proposes a novel definition of deponency: deponents are morphologically non-active verbs with non-canonical agent arguments that are merged below VoiceP. Since VoiceP is spelled out with non-active morphology in those languages if it does not introduce an external argument itself, the result is a surface mismatch between morphological form and syntactic function. This proposal predicts that only certain non-finite forms of deponents will surface with the syntax/morphology-mismatch, namely those that include VoiceP. Nominalizations
without VoiceP will appear to suspend the voice mismatch. These predictions are shown to be correct with respect to the behavior of deponent participles in the languages under study. 
The insight that deponency depends on the availability of certain
projections along the ""verbal spine"" can be used as a diagnostic for the internal
structure of participial and other deverbal formations in languages with a ""Greek-type"" voice system and provides an explanation of the morphosyntax of deponents that goes beyond characterizing them as lexical idiosyncrasies.",0
"The purpose of this paper is to develop a theory of resolution of gender values in conjunct agreement, ultimately couched in a theory of copying and nondistinctness. Ideally, as the resolution mechanism is implemented in terms of an agreement mechanism initiated within the &P, it should draw on tools of feature-based computation found elsewhere in the grammar. However, &P-internal agreement is unique within the grammar in that the two participating goals (namely, each conjunct) are equidistant from the &P head in question (assuming it is specified as needing to probe twice). As a result, existing mechanisms such as Multiple Agree (Hiraiwa, 2001, Anagnostopoulou, 2005), which are based on one goal being hierarchically higher than the other, and employed in accounts such as the Person-Case Constraint, are inapplicable. Instead, the closest grammatical parallels to an agreement mechanism with equidistant goals are found in phonology, and it will be proposed that precisely such a mechanism is shared in these two domains, even though they instantiate distinct modules of the grammar. As such, the analysis offered in this paper instantiates a case of Crossmodular Structural Parallelism, a hypothesis about the reuse of operations such as featural agreement, featural deletion, and feature co-occurrence constraints across domains of morphosyntactic and phonological features, and one that has been a fruitful part of linguistic theory throughout the work of Andrea Calabrese (e.g. Calabrese 1998) and many works inspired by it.",0
"This dissertation has two central foci: (i) it examines the behavioral contrasts of perspective-sensitive elements such as evidentials in questions and assertions; (ii) it investigates the connection between alternative questions and the clausal disjunction-embedder 'whether'. The overall theme of the dissertation is an exploration into the interaction of questions and doxastic domains, set within formal syntactic, semantic and pragmatic theories. The main empirical focus is the South Asian (Indo Aryan; India, Bangladesh) language Bangla (also known as Bengali), which is analyzed based on the native speaker judgements of the author, as well as several surveys collected from other native speakers. 

The interaction of perspectival elements with speech acts have been a relatively under-explored area of study. I undertake the study of evidentials (elements marking an agent's source of information). I argue for a theory that is both syntax and semantics informed. In particular, I propose that evidentials crucially take only finite clauses as complements, and derive their interpretation from a `judge' that is syntactically represented in the left periphery, and that interacts with other perspectival heads both inside the finite clause as well as the speech-act projection. This approach enables a unified analysis of the Bangla evidential 'naki', that changes its evidential flavor based on its syntactic position. In the interpretative component, I argue that evidentials embody either Involved (committed) or Uninvolved (not committed) sources of information. I propose that the world's evidentials come in two shapes: those that effect Interrogative Flip (shifting of perspective from the speaker to addressee in questions) and those that do not, and I locate the difference in a formal semantic property. This formal property predicts the presence or absence of bias in questions with evidentials, and forges a cross-linguistic link between evidentiality and bias.

The second focus of the dissertation is alternative questions and disjunction. The main claim offered is that there is a crucial connection between interrogative and 'whether' in Bangla: they are underlying the same element 'kina'. The surface differences between the two constructions is shown to be derivable from the syntactic processes of head movement and ellipsis. This unification claim has not been undertaken for any other language in the literature. I argue that this claim is also semantically viable, and propose an Alternative Semantics-theoretic analysis that can explain the presence of 'kina' (`whether') in Bangla alternative questions. This analysis, while focussed on Bangla, also makes predictions in an area that is understudied in the world's languages - the interrogative-boolean divide within the universal disjunction space. I undertake a comparative study with Mandarin Chinese, and investigate the locus of the divide in the two languages. Bangla is a language that does not display focus intervention effects in alternative questions and does not allow disjunctive subjects with interrogative disjunction. I demonstrate that these disparate properties can be explained with the main proposal. In addition, I explore split questions in Bangla and show how disjunctive subjects can be hosted by split questions. This study fits into the overall theme of the dissertation by furthering the understanding of Bangla questions and their interaction with other domains such as disjunction and perspective-sensitivity, as viewed from the standpoint of the syntax-semantics-pragmatic interfaces.",0
"Anti-agreement (AA, Ouhalla 1993 and since) is usually characterized as involving phi-agreement with T and A-to-A' movement. In this paper, I discuss Tamil AA which involves a nominalizing N and A'-to-A'- movement. Based on this and other data, I then argue that an adequate AA theory needs to be able to make reference to specific phi-probing heads. I evaluate current theories of AA paying special attention to Baier (2017b, 2017c)'s morphological account of AA. I propose that this theory requires morphology to have information that the syntactic component does not have even in a feature-sharing approach to AGREE (Frampton & Gutmann 2000). As such I argue that AA is decided in the syntax and occurs when a head fails to copy any of the features of a potential goal including any phi-features that may be needed for valuation. I formalize this account in OT, following Erlewine (2016) and show how it can be extended to account for what Baier (2017c) calls partial AA.",0
This dissertation presents a model for capturing analogy (analogical classifiers) in terms of inheritance hierarchies and constraints. I show that results from computational models closely match the theoretical analyses. The result is that analogy can be modeled in terms of the same objects as other grammar components. This allows for seamless integration of analogical systems into theories like HPSG or SBCG.,0
"Words pose a theoretical challenge in Chinese, but words pose a challenge in any language. There is as much evidence for a level of representation somewhere between morphemes and phrases in Chinese as there is in English. Yet as with English, the evidence reveals Chinese words as dynamic, sometimes more like lexicalized wholes and sometimes more like decomposable complexes. Moreover, while semantics, phonology, syntax, and psycholinguistics all point roughly at a word level in Chinese (and English), they do not point in exactly the same direction. After reviewing well-known problems with wordhood in English, linguistic and psycholinguistic evidence for the word level in Chinese, and signs that Chinese words are as variable in nature as they are in English, I show how naive discriminative learning may help express the dynamism of wordhood.

"Obviation is a well-known feature of the Algonquian languages, but in the theoretical literature there is no consensus regarding its nature. This paper proposes a theoretical approach to obviation that is intended to capture not only its morphosyntactic properties but also the crucial role that discourse factors play in its patterning. The analysis combines two existing ideas: Richards' (2010) proposal that proximate nominals are DP while obviatives are KP and Branigan and MacKenzie's (1999) proposal that the reference of proximate nominals is controlled by an operator in CP. The main proposal is that the Algonquian clause includes an operator in CP that binds all DPs in its domain unless a KP layer intervenes. There are thus two kinds of third-person nominals in Algonquian: proximate nominals, as DPs, are obligatorily coreferent with the CP operator, while obviative nominals, as KPs, have independent reference. By connecting the DP-KP distinction to the CP level, we gain a unified account of the pragmatics and morphosyntax of obviation: the discourse-governed properties reflect the choice of referent for the topic operator in CP, the morphosyntactic properties follow from the DP-KP asymmetry, and the link between discourse and morphosyntax lies in the referential properties of the nominals: if a nominal is coreferent with the CP operator, it must have DP morphosyntax; if it is disjoint, it must have KP morphosyntax.",0
"In this paper, I provide an account for the so-called Blansitt's generalisation (Blansitt 1988). The generalisation says that in the linear sequence DATIVE-ALLATIVE-LOCATIVE, only adjacent functions may be marked the same. In previous work (Bobaljik 2012; Starke 2009; Caha 2009), analogous *ABA patterns have been encoded by the so-called feature cumulation. Feature cumulation means that the amount of features characteristic for individual categories monotonically grows in the order given in any such sequence. However, Blansitt observes that in the case of datives, allatives and locatives, the allative (which is in the middle) tends to be composed of the dative and the locative, so the account based on cumulation does not work. The present paper thus argues for a different representation of the underlying categories, namely as containing (abstractly) the features A, AB and B respectively (following in part Bobaljik & Sauerland 2017). I refer to this as the ""overlapping"" decomposition. When such a decomposition is combined with the Superset Principle (Starke 2009), it yields both the *ABA restriction and the observed syncretism and containment patterns. I further argue that this is a non-trivial result, since traditional underspecification approaches face significant challenges in deriving the *ABA pattern on the basis of the overlapping decomposition.",0
"The reduplicative systems of the ancient Indo-European languages are characterized by an unusual alternation in the shape of the reduplicant. The related languages Ancient Greek, Gothic, and Sanskrit share the property that root-initial consonant clusters exhibit different reduplicant shapes, depending on their featural composition. Moreover, even though the core featural distinction largely overlaps across the languages, the actual patterns which instantiate that distinction are themselves distinct across the languages. For roots beginning in stop-sonorant clusters (TRVX– roots), each of these languages agrees in displaying a prefixal CV reduplicant, where the consonant corresponds to the root-initial stop: TV-TRVX–. These three languages likewise agree that roots beginning in
sibilant-stop clusters (STVX– roots) show some pattern other than the one exhibited by TRVX– roots. However, each of the three languages exhibits a distinct alternative pattern: V-STVX– in the case of Ancient Greek, STV-STVX– in the case of Gothic, TV-STVX– in the case of Sanskrit.

This dissertation provides an integrated synchronic and diachronic theoretical account of the morphophonological properties of verbal reduplication in the ancient Indo-European languages, with its central focus being to explain this core alternation between TRVX– roots and STVX– roots. Set within Base-Reduplicant Correspondence Theory, a framework for analyzing reduplication in Optimality Theory, the comprehensive synchronic analyses constructed in service of understanding
this distinction and other interrelated distinctions allow us to probe complex theoretical questions regarding the constraints and constraint interactions involved in the determination of reduplicant shape.

This dissertation seeks not only to develop in depth, consistent accounts of both the productive and marginal/archaic morphophonological aspects of reduplication in the Indo-European languages, it aims to understand the origins of these patterns-from a historical and comparative perspective,
and from the perspective of morphophonological learning and grammar change - and attempts to motivate the conditions for the onset, development, and retention of the changes that result in the systems observed in the attested languages. As such, these analyses constitute a valuable set of case studies on complex systemic change in phonological grammars.",0
"There has been a growing body of interests in sound symbolic patterns in natural languages, in which some sounds are associated with particular meanings. As a case study, a previous corpus-based research identified some specific sound symbolic relationships in Pokemon naming patterns in Japanese [1]. One of the main findings was that the names of Pokemon characters are more likely to contain voiced obstruents and are longer in terms of mora counts, when they undergo evolution (e.g.  yoromo/ =>  yorobon/; /poppo/ => /pijotto/.). The current study reports three experiments that test whether (i) these patterns are productive in the minds of general Japanese speakers (Experiments 1 and 2), and whether (ii) the same tendency would hold with English speakers (Experiment 3). The results show that the effect of mora length was clearly observed both with Japanese speakers and English speakers; the effects of voiced obstruents were observed clearly with Japanese speakers, and less clearly with English speakers. Further analyses show that familiarity with Pokemon may influence their responses, suggesting the possibility that speakers can learn sound-symbolic patterns from a particular set of lexical items (i.e. ""the Pokemon lexicon""). Besides its research value, we argue that this general project can be useful for undergraduate phonetics education.

"This dissertation develops optimality-theoretic analyses of word-level stress assignment in
two languages with lexical accent, Cupeño (Takic, Uto-Aztecan) and Hittite (Anatolian, Indo-
European); it also assesses the implications of word stress in Hittite and the other Anatolian
languages for the reconstruction of stress assignment in Proto-Indo-European.

I argue that stress assignment in Cupeño is governed by the BASIC ACCENTUATION PRINCIPLE (BAP; Kiparsky and Halle 1977): stress is assigned to the leftmost lexically accented morpheme, else to the word's left edge. This analysis is compared to that of Alderete (1999, 2001), who argues that Cupeño shows accentual root faithfulness - i.e., that the accentual properties of roots are privileged over non-root morphemes. I show that the BAP analysis is both simpler and attains greater empirical coverage than the root faithfulness analysis, which fails to account for certain attested stress patterns that are captured under the BAP analysis. Thus reanalyzed, Cupeño has two important typological implications. First, without support from Cupeño, root faithfulness may be unattested as a feature of lexical accent systems. Second, Cupeño provides a clear typological parallel for the ancient IE languages on the basis of which the BAP was posited - in particular, Vedic Sanskrit - as well as for Hittite, where I argue that it is also operative. 

The analysis of Hittite stress advanced in this dissertation is the first systematic attempt at a synchronic generative treatment of its word stress patterns. Having established that stress
assignment in Hittite inflection is governed by the BAP, I also adduce evidence for accentual
dominance - i.e., morphemes whose accentual specification ""overrides"" the BAP. I propose that accentual dominance in Hittite is a consequence of morphological headedness: the lexical
accent of the word's head morpheme is privileged in Hittite, just as Revithiadou (1999) has
argued for other lexical accent systems.

Finally, this dissertation addresses the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word-prosodic system. Hittite and the other Anatolian languages are not traditionally viewed as important sources for the reconstruction of this system; however, I contend that the BAP is reconstructible for PIE and that - against this traditional view - this reconstruction depends
crucially on the Anatolian evidence, which converges with Vedic Sanskrit in this respect.",1
"In this dissertation, we develop and defend a universal theory of concord (i.e. feature sharing between a head noun and the modifying adjectives). We claim that (i) the mechanism for concord is uniform across the grammars of natural languages and (ii) the overt manifestation of concord is suppressed by the intervention of phasal domains. 

When adjectives in a language show concord with the noun they modify, concord morphology usually involves the full set of features of that noun (e.g. gender, number and case). However, there are also languages in which concord targets only a subset of morphosyntactic features of the head noun. We observe that feature combinations that enter into concord in such languages are not random. We show that this observation can be explained with a theory of concord that has the following properties: (i) concord is obligatory whenever phasal domains are inactive (the obligatoriness claim) and (ii) languages that lack concord have phasal Noun Phrase (the phase claim). We provide evidence supporting these claims.

The obligatoriness claim leads to two predictions: (1) idiosyncratic gender languages are gender concord languages and (2) languages with pluralia tantum nouns are plural concord languages. We show that these predictions are empirically supported.

The phase claim implies that a language lacks overt manifestation of concord only if it has a phasal NP. We show that, due to the phasal status of NP, non-concord languages exhibit the following properties: (1) AP movement out of NP is not possible, (2) the Num head need not be obligatory in the extended projection of a noun (leading to number neutrality) and (3) nominal inflectional elements can be shared between coordinated nouns. We provide evidence supporting these claims.",1
"In this (slightly revised version of my) MA thesis, I try to lay out a comprehensive survey of *ABA effects in case morphology, with an emphasis on case syncretism, case-based wholesale suppletion, and case-based stem-formative allomorphy. All three of these phenomena, I claim, are universally constrained by the following generalization:  No Vocabulary-Insertion rule can apply both to an unmarked core-case (nominative or absolutive) and to an inherent case (dative, instrumental, locative, etc.) without also applying to a dependent core-case (ergative or accusative).


This generalization traces back to work by Baerman et al. (2005) and Caha (2009) on syncretism, by McFadden (2014) on stem allomorphy, and by Smith et al. (2016) on suppletion. However, most of these works, albeit largely consistent with each other, invoke some or other distinctive qualification or supplementation to the general pattern. Here I argue, in contrast, that such divergences are not empirically warranted, and that the match between the patterns of the three phenomena is indeed perfect or nearly so. This argument rests, most notably, on a critique of Caha's (2009) proposals concerning several other supposed *ABA universals in syncretisms with or among inherent cases. 

Next, drawing again on Caha (2009), I interpret the *ABA patterns referenced above as evidence for a containment hierarchy [[[UNMARKED] DEPENDENT] INHERENT]. I then observe that the lightest cases in this containment hierarchy, i.e. nominative and absolutive, are also the same cases that are given ""elsewhere"" status in Marantz' (1991) configurational theory of case assignment. This suggests that there may be a structural economy principle at work, whereby additional case layers such as those of dependent and inherent cases may only be deployed when the lighter unmarked cases are, in a sense to be made precise, ""not enough.""",1

"I report the results of a wug task to connect issues of bilingualism and language dominance to psycholinguistic methods, showing that language dominance plays a role in the morphological variation found in Maltese. Research on structural borrowing in language contact situations suggests that morphological borrowing occurs when bilinguals are in a situation where one language is dominant (Brown, 2003). In addition, psycholinguistics research suggests that bilinguals perform differently from monolinguals in metalinguistic tasks (Galambos & Hakuta, 1988; Campbell & Sais, 1995), particularly when they are dominant in one language. The results of the present study suggest that language dominance may be a reliable predictor of their responses.

Maltese, a Semitic language derived from Siculo-Arabic, has had extensive contact with Italian and English as reflected in its lexicon, where roughly half of the words are derived from Arabic and half from Italian and English (Mifsud, 1995). Maltese morphology exhibits both Semitic root-and-pattern word formations (vocalic patterns inserted around a triconsonantal root), as well as formations using concatenative morphology (Borg & Azzopardi-Alexander, 1997). Previous work showed differences in morphological productivity in root-and-pattern versus concatenative constructions (Twist, 2006; Spagnol, 2011), posing a challenge for the development of an accurate model of Maltese morphology. 

Maltese speakers are bilingual, speaking both Maltese and English. Prior psycholinguistic research has found that bilinguals perform differently on metalinguistic tasks (Galambos & Hakuta, 1988; Campbell & Sais, 1995), and bilinguals who are dominant in one language also perform differently from monolinguals and balanced bilinguals (Galambos & Hakuta, 1988; Gathercole, 2007). In addition, sociolinguistic research on Maltese suggests that bilingualism and language contact in tandem with lexical innovation drives language change (Fabri, 2011), particularly in lexical items and novel applications of bound morphemes (e.g., English nerd 'nerd' --> Maltese tinnerdja 'to behave like a nerd').",0
"In this paper, we address a long standing assumption about English morphology: that regular plural morphology is generally banned within modifiers of compounds, while irregular morphology is generally allowed (see: Thomas-Flinders 1983, Kiparsky 1982, Hammond 1984, and Sproat 1985, among others). We argue that this pattern is illusory. It is brought about by a conspiracy of other restrictions derived through bifurcated Num(ber) functional heads (cf. Lecarme 2002, Borer 2005, Lowenstamm 2008, Wiltschko 2008, Alexiadou 2011, Kramer 2012, 2016, Mathieu 2012, 2014, and Adamson 2017, among others) and an incorporation analysis of English compounds coupled with cyclic spell out (Harley 2009, Jackson & Punske 2013). General patterns of allowing or disallowing plural modification are explained through selection of complements by a head, which is a consequence of the incorporation analysis.",0

"This paper is concerned with a comparative study of the syntactic derivation of two types of nominal phrases (non-predicative de-constructions and generic de-constructions) and the morphological derivation of the corresponding nominal compounds (endocentric nominal compounds and synthetic nominal compounds) in Mandarin (Chinese).

The paper shows that mismatches between each type of nominal phrases and the corresponding nominal compounds in Mandarin with respect to LF interpretation and PF Vocabulary Insertion may be accounted for by a single Spell-Out model of morpho-syntax which postulates that morphological and syntactic derivations may share one Numeration and one single Spell-Out. 

Despite the fact that syntactic derivations and morphological derivations differ with respect to how Merge and Move work, the paper shows that similarities between the morphological derivation of each type of nominal compounds and the syntactic derivations of the corresponding nominal phrase may have consequences for the nature of modification and nominalization and their relation to argument structure.",0
"In this paper I will examine allocutive agreement in Tamil, a phenomenon in which an agreement suffix attached to the verb or other clause-final element indexes features not of any argument, but of the addressee of the utterance. I will report in detail on the morphophonology, syntactic distribution and discourse use, supplementing the basic facts reported by Amritavalli (1991) with several additional crucial details, and will compare the Tamil data with what has been reported for other languages, especially Basque and Japanese. I will then discuss the consequences of Tamil allocutive agreement for the theoretical treatment of how discourse information interacts with the morphosyntax, leading to a preliminary analysis of the patterns I find. We will see that the Tamil data provide interesting insights into the structural representation of the addressee and into how allocutive agreement is derived, in particular from how the relevant suffix is ordered relative to other verbal material.",0
"This thesis is a study of the syntax of multi-verb constructions, in which a single clause contains more than one verbal element. Multi-verb constructions are of special interest in light of the hypothesis that clausal structure is headed by a verb. Implemented in terms of extended projections, this hypothesis states that clausal functional structure is the extended projection of a verb. A full understanding of multi-verbal constructions, in which there is no one-to-one verb–clause mapping, relies on refinements of the intimate relation between clause structure and the verbal category. Analyzing various types of multi-verb constructions in Ndebele, a Bantu language of Zimbabwe, I propose a theory multi-verbal syntax which makes explicit the ways in which a single extended projection may contain more than one verb. I propose a basic distinction within the verbal category into projecting verbs and non-projecting verbs. Projecting verbs have the ability to head a full clause and are what we typically think of as lexical verbs. Non-projecting verbs, on the other hand, are inherently unable to project full clausal structure. There are two types of non-projecting verbs in Ndebele. Aspectual auxiliaries are lexical items whose category feature has mixed properties: it has properties of both a lexical verb and some functional head in the clausal spine. The mixed properties are detected by different aspects of their syntax. The second type of non-projecting verb is the default auxiliary (be, in Ndebele), used in compound tenses. The default auxiliary is a verbal expletive, which becomes part of the derivation via last-resort selection. Any multi-verbal construction with more than one lexical (projecting) verb necessarily contains more than one extended projection. Additionally, the thesis is concerned with the role of two syntactic dependencies in the inflectional domain: agreement and selection. Both relations are involved in determining the morphological shape of multi-verb constructions by posing restrictions on the form, category and size of the main lexical verb. Depending on the light/auxiliary verb, it can be a participle (imperfective, past or future), have a subjunctive form (present or past), or be infinitival/clausal. It is argued that such cooccurrence patterns are largely predictable from clause structure and agreement. Selection is involved only in a small set of idiosyncratic cases of complement selection.",0
"This article presents empirical evidence that disfavors using highly lexicalist minimalist models, such as the one presented in Chomsky (1995), when analyzing language mixing. The data analyzed consist of English-Spanish mixed noun phrases discussed in Moro (2014) as well as English-Norwegian mixed noun phrases and verbs taken from the Corpus of American Norwegian Speech. Whereas the lexicalist model in Chomsky (1995) only can explain a subset of the mixing patterns attested in both authentic English-Spanish mixed noun phrases and the American Norwegian corpus, we show that an alternative exoskeletal model can account for all of them. Such a model would entail that rather than assuming lexical items with inherent, functional features that determine the derivation, syntactic structures are generated independently from the lexical items that come to realize them.",0
"In several three cell paradigms, it has been observed that one
logically conceivable pattern – ABA under some arrangement of cells – is
unattested. Existing approaches assume that such *ABA generalizations
provide evidence for feature inventories which are restricted to features that
stand in containment relations, and are thus subject to Pāṇinian rule order.
We present a novel approach to *ABA generalizations that derives from
general properties of feature-based morphology. To this end, we develop a
formal account of the widespread view that morphological paradigms derive
from rules that relate abstract features from an inventory to morphological
exponents. We demonstrate that the feature-based view restricts the space
of typological patterns even without any further assumptions. We show furthermore
that the feature-based theory derives *ABA as a special case of a
broader class of generalizations if the number of features in the inventory
must be minimal, and that these generalizations arise under a variety of general
assumptions about feature-algebras (extrinsically ordered or Pāṇinian
and with or without feature intersection). We discuss which explanation
might be correct for actual cases of *ABA constraints, and we explore the
consequences of the feature-based general approach for a range of paradigm
sizes including those with more than three cells.",0
"Gaps in morphological paradigms are often explained in terms of blocking: generating one form is blocked by the existence of a paraphrase. Another way of thinking about paradigm gaps dissociates their existence from competition between forms. Unlike in competition-based approaches, systematic gaps can be seen as true gaps; the system might not generate a certain form, but this form is not considered in comparison to others. Adopting this latter approach, we argue that inflectional paradigms are neither morphosyntactic primitives nor the result of competition. This claim is supported by data from two unrelated languages. For Hebrew, we demonstrate that a passive gap is not the result of competition with analytic paraphrases. For Latin, we show that a cyclic, syntax-based approach is superior to a theory that generates nonactive verbs in the lexicon and has them compete against each other. Systematic paradigm gaps are thus argued to result from syntactic structure building, without competition regulating independent morphological constructions.",0
"As is well known, the control dependency in grammar is broadly distinguished into two broad classes: exhaustive (i → i) and non-exhaustive (i → i+(j)). The goal of this paper is to show that languages seem to allow another type of control in addition to these and to provide a formal account for how it may be derived in grammar. This new type of control is neither exhaustive nor strictly non-exhaustive, in the sense described above. Rather, it involves a mapping between an individual i and another individual f(i), where f is a discourse-contextually defined function denoting some sort of social group or class membership, and where i is not = f(i). We call this new type of control ""proxy control"", in analogy with instances of proxy anaphora (Jackendoff 1992, Schladt 2000, Reuland and Winter 2009) which have also been argued to involve a relation of this nature. Proxy control is interesting not only because it extends the typology of possible control relations in grammar, but also because it raises interesting questions about the distribution of OC vs. NOC and the factors that condition the parametric choice between the two. Our primary data comes from German and Italian collected from native speakers in in-person grammaticality judgment tasks and online surveys. For speakers of the southern standard dialects of German (Bavarian-Swabian, Swabian, Bavarian, and Austrian) and the Grossetano dialect of Italian (spoken in parts of Tuscany), we present empirical diagnostics to show that proxy control instantiates a species of OC. For the rest of the native speakers of German and Italian tested, proxy control instantiates a choice of NOC. We focus primarily on proxy OC in this paper and propose that it involves a kind of ""cyclic"" control: the first cycle involves a i → f (i) control dependency into a bouletic modal complement; the second, an f(i) → f(i) exhaustive control dependency into a deontic modal clause. Proxy OC is the composite consisting of these put together. We present agreement evidence from floating quantifiers in Italian and Condition B obviation effects in German to argue that the i → f (i) relation is not established in syntax: rather, a simple i → i exhaustive control relation alone is syntactically encoded. This i on the controllee (PRO) is then semantically extended at LF to f(i) (following an adaption of the extension semantics for partial control in Pearson 2016) yielding i → f (i). Toward the end of the paper, we turn to a discussion of dialectal and crosslinguistic variation for proxy control, which revolves around whether proxy control is instantiated as a species of OC or NOC. We discuss the nature of the variation in detail and also propose the ways in which such variation could be theoretically understood and modelled within the analytic framework of our approach to proxy OC.",1
"In this paper, I argue that all of the conjuncts in nominal conjunction always bear the same case. Apparent counterexamples, where conjuncts seem to differ with respect to morphological case marking, are claimed to be either due to a misanalysis of the underlying syntactic structure or due to superficial morphological processes that create the impression of a difference in case marking. Once we control for phenomena of this sort (namely &P-clitics, Suspended Affixation and Allomorphy), we find that case marking is always symmetric in nominal conjunction. This finding is in stark contrast to the phenomenon of phi-agreement which is known to exhibit asymmetry effects. Based on this observation, I show that the standard approach to case assignment according to which case arises only as a reflex of phi-agreement cannot account for this mismatch without stipulative assumptions. Under two more recent approaches to case marking, however, namely the Upward Agree approach as well as the Dependent Case Approach, the observed mismatch between case and agreement falls out as expected. Finally, I show that the generalization established in this paper can be used as a simple diagnostic to distinguish syntactic from morphological case marking alternations.",0
"We present a novel account of root suppletion in comparatives and superlatives, and show how it accounts for the presence of ABB and ABC patterns, as well as the absence of ABA patterns. The account assumes that suppletive roots, despite appearances to the contrary, are not contextual allomorphs, but portmanteaus spelling out two distinct features, one belonging to the lexical root, and another one belonging to the comparative. The regular comparative affix then spells out an additional feature relating to the comparative domain. In other words, we show that the comparative (CMPR) head that enters into the morphological makeup of the comparative (Bobaljik 2012) is to be split up into two distinct heads, C1 and C2 (see also Caha 2016). We extend this idea to SPRL, which we show is likewise to be split up into S1 and S2, in order to account for suppletive ABC patterns. These four distinct heads receive empirical support from facts of the degree morphology in Czech and Latin. The new account of root suppletion allows a straightforward way of deriving the attested and unattested patterns of (root) suppletion in degree comparison. The analysis developed supports the hypothesis that the absence of AAB patterns in degree comparison is due to a constraint of a different nature altogether.",1
"In many languages, φ-agreement with a DP is disrupted when that DP is involved in an A'dependency (e.g. wh-movement, relativization). Since Ouhalla 1993, this phenomenon has been known as anti-agreement. In this paper, we investigate cases of anti-agreement in which an A'extracted argument triggers anti-agreement not only on its locally φ-agreeing head, but also on a lower head that φ-agrees with a pronoun bound by the extracted argument (bound anti-agreement). Bound anti-agreement has received little attention in previous literature. Crucially, since the bound variable does not itself undergo movement, bound anti-agreement presents a challenge for analyses of anti-agreement that derive the effect through constraints on A'-movement. We argue instead that bound anti-agreement lends strong support to Baier's (2016) featural theory of anti-agreement, in which anti-agreement is the result of a φ-probe agreeing with an A'-operator bearing the feature [wh]. We moreover analyze bound anti-agreement in a parallel fashion to fake indexicals, thus unifying these two seemingly separate phenomena. Bound anti-agreement supports an analysis of fake indexicals in which a variable is 'born' underspecified, but acquires its features from its antecedent in the course of the derivation (e.g. Kratzer 2009). The features of the variable may be realized on the variable itself (as with fake indexicals) or as agreement with the variable (as seen in cases of bound anti-agreement).",0
"This thesis provides an investigation of non-possessive nominal person from a crosslinguistic perspective, i.e. variation in the way that the grammatical person of nominal expressions is marked across languages. The most prominent construction of this type are adnominal pronoun constructions (APCs) of the we linguists type.
The first part of the thesis provides a survey of expressions of nominal person in a sample of 92 languages from 44 genera, to my knowledge the first larger scale overview of its kind. I review the observable crosslinguistic variation with respect to word order, the presence or absence of definite articles, the possibility of the co-occurrence of demonstratives with pronouns and with respect to restrictions on person-number combinations in expressions of
nominal person.
The second part examines the applicability of the classical pronominal determiner analysis (Abney 1987, Postal 1969) to the data collected in the survey, in particular with respect to word order, the co-occurrence of adnominal pronouns with articles and the person-number restrictions on expressions of nominal person. I discuss alternatives and amendments to the pronominal determiner analysis for problematic data, one important outcome being that
nominal person is not universally encoded in the same position as definiteness.
In the third part, I review the so-called unagreement phenomenon as a case of non-overt nominal person marking and discuss the interaction of person with other deictic features in the nominal domain: the possibility of demonstrative constructions to control non-third person agreement in a few languages as well as personal pronoun-demonstrative constructions (PPDCs) involving demonstratives co-occurring with personal pronouns in some languages. The existence of the latter constructions suggests that person is not universally encoded in the same syntactic position as demonstratives. 
The overall picture emerging is that there is crosslinguistic variation in the locus of person in the extended nominal projection and the types of features that are encoded on the same head as person, although there appears to be a universal tendency for person to be in a relatively high position.",0
"Italo-Romance varieties exhibit a number of phenomena that are quite rare among Romance. Some varieties, for instance, have a dedicated gender marking on the finite verb, unlike any other Romance language. The same varieties also exhibit adverbial and prepositional agreement. Furthermore, whenever a topic is present in the clause it will trigger agreement: finite verbs, non-finite verbs (participles and gerunds), adverbs, as well as prepositions will show agreement with the topic. 

Topic-driven agreement, I argue, is due to two co-occurring causes: 1. the presence of an extra item, a φ-probe, in the lexical inventory of the language; 2. A special setup of this probe, which requires agreement with the topic.

"This paper offers a unified approach to Italian Spatial prepositions, such as di fronte a 'in front of', verso 'towards', in 'in', dietro a 'behind', and nel mezzo di 'in the middle of'. Three assumptions play a key role. First, Italian Spatial Prepositions can differ sensibly in their morphological structure, but share the same syntactic properties. Second, their sentential distribution is in part context-sensitive, thus based on the categories with which they combine. Third, their semantic contribution is ""layered"", in the sense that it includes the meaning dimensions of both aspectual boundedness and specificity. The main result is a generalised theory on the structure and semantic interpretation of these prepositions.",0
"In this paper we argue that there are two different kinds of syntactic ergativity attested across Mayan languages. In languages that are (predominantly) VOS, the ban on A-bar extraction of the transitive subject arises because of a blocking effect of the kind proposed by Aldridge (2008), Coon et al. (2014). This explains the O>S word order but also the fact that straightforward extraction of all vP-internal material is banned. In the case of predominantly VSO languages, however, we propose that syntactic ergativity affects only the transitive subject: extraction of vP-internal adjuncts is unrestricted. This is because in S>O languages, the extraction restriction results from anti-locality, of the kind proposed by Erlewine (2016). We argue, moreover, that both kinds of syntactic ergativity in these languages ultimately arise due to defective intervention of the ergative subject in the Agree relation between INFL and the internal argument. There are essentially two ways to circumvent this problem: either S 'sidesteps' to spec INFL, or O leapfrogs to the outer spec vP.",0
"This dissertation proposes a model of the syntax-phonology interface within the word; in this model, morphosyntax is cyclic but phonology is parallel. Words that span multiple phases (Chomsky 2000, 2001, Marantz 2001) are transferred from syntax to phonology (""spelled out"") multiple times. The spelled out material is evaluated by a parallel Optimality Theory grammar (OT; Prince and Smolensky 1993/2004), which builds output prosodic structure. The cyclic syntax-parallel phonology model predicts that transferring words from syntax to phonology over multiple phases results in recursion of Phonological Words (PWds) in some languages (Ito and Mester 2009). In these languages, including Chukchansi Yokuts (firsthand fieldwork) and Creek (data from Martin 2011), prosodic recursion reflects cyclic word construction. The input representation of multiphasal verbs and prosodic well-formedness and Match constraints together generate a typology including languages with different recursive PWd structures or no PWd recursion at all. The predicted typology of prosodic structures of multiphasal words closely matches the attested range of language variation. 

This dissertation brings together insights from several theories in multiple sub-fields of linguistics, including Phase Theory, the Copy Theory of Movement, Distributed Morphology and Match Theory. The cyclic syntax-parallel phonology model provides a tool for assessing the claims of one sub-field using evidence from another sub-field. The prosodic organization of a word can provide insight into its phasal derivation; conversely, the morphosyntactic structure of a word can shed light on the complex prosodic structure it displays.",0
"We make a case for morphemes as zones of functional sequence (`fseq zones') in Nanosyntax.
Under such an approach, morphemes which compete for insertion with each other form
the same fseq zone, while morphemes which co-occur together form different fseq zones. We
illustrate this on the basis of the participle zone that is projected on top of verb stems in Slavic
languages. We argue that in Polish and Czech this participle zone spells out as L, T, or N,
depending on its size and internal constituent structure. The constituent structure of this zone
provides a direct solution to the long-standing puzzle in Polish and Czech morphology, namely
why only unaccusative verbs built adjectival L-passives while all types of verbs build active
L-participles.  [The current version only corrects a typo present in v1, hence both drafts are dated as June 8, 2017]",0
"This paper aims to demonstrate that a morpho-phonological pattern that has been central to the development of morpho-syntactic theories has been misanalysed. The pattern in question is the existence of two classes of affixes in English; Level 1 affixes, which are included in the phonological domain of the base to which they attach, and Level 2 affixes, which are external to the phonological domain to which they attach.   Since SPE, generative grammarians have taken it as given that the distinction between Level 1 and Level 2 affixes is lexical. That is, the class-membership of a given affix is a feature that not only must be memorized, but is also a morphological diacritic. This diacritic is necessary iff there is no other relevant distinction between the two groups of affixes. 
	It is the goal here to demonstrate that there is, in fact, another distinction between these affixes, and that this difference is the true source of the division of affixes into the Level 1 and Level 2 classes. The pertinent distinction has nothing to do with morpho-lexical classification, but is instead purely phonological. The first segment of Level 1 affixes is a floating vowel, while no Level 2 affixes begin with a floating vowel.",1
"It has been pointed out that there are languages that violate the Righthand Head Rule (RHR) for words and compounds (Williams (1981) among others). This paper argues that the languages violating RHR have righthand word-stress such as penultimate stress, which blocks head-final order in linearization. A stress-based theory of linearization (Tokizaki (2011), Tokizaki and Kuwana (2013b)) straightforwardly explains why RHR is observed in some languages and not in others. It is argued that we do not need morphological head parameters as well as syntactic head parameters.",0
"Arabic Gender comes in many flavours, expressing many 'unorthodox' meanings, more productively so than the so-called 'natural' (or 'cultural') sex (and/or animacy), and it is not confined to a particular 'lexical' category (namely n), or being an intrinsic nominal property (as in e.g. Corbett 1991, Dahl 2000). It is rather constructional, or built in syntax, distributing and receiving polysemous interpretations at various syntactic layers of the DP or CP, depending on quantity, perspective, evaluation, performativity, etc. Within this view, and apart from describing and identifying the various specifics of gender morphology, syntax, and semantics of some Arabic varieties, and investigating cross-linguistic parallels in other languages such as Romance, Berber, and Hebrew (see Fassi Fehri 2016 a &b), my broad empirical and theoretical interest in this article is to instantiate significant close interactions of the various grammatical categories found in the DP and Gender, and to account for how these interpenetrations follow naturally from appropriate hypotheses about articulation and design of grammatical architecture, framed in a form of what I will call functional universalism. Interactions of Gender, Classifier (typically unit or group atomizers), Number (or the 'many' pluralities), evaluation, and performativity are particularly examined.",0
"This paper aims at describing Q(uantity)-words, i.e. many/much and few/little, from a typological perspective, and presenting typological generalisations based on it. The typological sample provides support for a mass-count and positive-negative dimension in the domain of Q- words. Both dimensions also intersect. Along the negative dimension, it seems that languages fall into two groups: those having an opaque strategy for few/little and those having only an analytic strategy (not-much/many). Four patterns can be discerned on the basis of the sample, which are each exemplified by means of one language, i.e. English, Dutch, Wolof and Western Armenian. In addition, I make an attempt at developing a nanosyntactic analysis of the data, which aims to show how language variation in the domain of Q-words can be accounted for in terms of varying the size of lexically stored trees (Starke 2014). Finally, I show how one missing type of pattern is underivable on the basis of the analysis proposed.",1
"Abstract. This paper is a case study of the imperative clause type and its relation to other clause types in Swedish and German in a modular framework. We will argue that there are three independent clause types, the finite, the imperative and the infinitive clause type, the differences between them derived from a morphologically founded distinction between three verbal paradigms, the finite, the imperative and the infinitive one. 
		We will further show how the three basic clause types are built up by three autonomous and interdependent modular systems, the morpho-syntactic, the semantic and the speech act system. Whereas the morpho-syntactic system operates with valued and unvalued features of various kinds, like [finite] and [φ], the semantic system supplies modal operators, that will provide the clause type with a clause type meaning. The speech act system will turn the clause type with its clause type meaning into a speech act, being the act the speaker performs, when uttering a clause. Not until the clause is accepted as a proper speech act at the speech act interface, will it become speech.
	Like in Platzack & Rosengren (1998), we also once more claim, that the imperative clause type lacks TP, which in turn prevents it from getting a subject and embed. 
	Because of its non-finite, i.e. imperative head, the imperative clause will be a clause type in the system of clause types right from the morphological beginning. It differs substantially in its syntactic structure from the finite clause as well as from the infinitive clause, being a clause type with a head with only a 2nd person inflection. This difference results in a slim structure, univocal meaning and a restricted area of application, the speaker uttering it in order to make or allow the addressee to act according to a norm. It can hence only be used to talk TO the addressee, not ABOUT him.",0
"Kastner (2014, 2016), started developing a contemporary description of the Hebrew verb system in the framework of Distributed Morphology (DM). The goal of this article is to present a somewhat different approach (also within DM) to the understanding of Hebrew Roots.

In order to work with the entire set of Hebrew verbs, in Section 2 I classify the large number of verb classes into five Conjugations. Each of the five Conjugations subsumes a number of such smaller classes.

In Section 3, I describe the First, Second, and Third Conjugations. Section 4 follows with a discussion of the Fourth and Fifth Conjugations. In Section 5, I explain that in Medieval Hebrew, the word shoresh (when used in a philological context), corresponds to the contemporary scientific term Base, rather than Root.",0
"In this article I argue that the Hebrew 3-to-5-consonantal Bases cannot possibly be considered roots in the framework of Distributed Morphology, despite the fact that they are traditionally called in Hebrew 'shorashim'. 

These Bases are formed by merging the underlying category-less roots with the category-defining functional heads. The resulting 3-to-5 consonantal Bases are each fully specified as verbal, nominal or adjectival. They are certainly not category-less. It is to these Bases that inflectional morphology is attached which generates various word forms.",0
"Distributed Morphology literature (Marantz 2001, Arad 2003, a.o.) argues that roots lack category and syntactic features. However, recent work on gender and number-marking languages frequently arrives at the conclusion that grammatical gender must be a property of the nominal representation stored in the lexicon (Steriopolo and Wiltschko 2008 , Kramer 2009, a.o.), while other authors argue that it is a proper- ty of a higher functional head (Ritter 1993, 1995, Kramer 2015 a.o.). In addition, some authors, most no- tably Harley (2015), argue for roots being able to take syntactic complements (contra Alexiadou 2014, Svenonius 2014, a.o.). We argue that the theoretical disagreement has an empirical underpinning. Roots may have syntactic features but this structural property interacts with derivational timing: if a root does not have any active syntactic features, then it must be Late Inserted. In contrast, roots with active syntac- tic features must be inserted early in order for those features to be available to syntactic computation. The empirical picture gets further complicated by the fact that the geometry of features on roots does not nec- essarily match the geometry of features in the extended functional domain. The empirical evidence comes
from gender marking in Polish profession attributive nouns.",0
"The paper consists of two parts. The first part focuses on A'ingae (Cofán) shape morphology, an unusual amalgam of classifier-like semantics and nominalizing syntax. An exegesis of previous literature is presented (specifically, Fisher and Hengeveld (forthcoming) and Borman (1976)), disagreements between the two accounts exposed, and a reconciliation attempted. The addition of a new shape morpheme -fo'cho is proposed. The second part presents data suggesting that those very same morphemes can be used in a more clitic-like way, akin to the agent nominalizer ='su. The similarities and differences between shape clitics and ='su are discussed. It is concluded that the clitic must match the shape of the subordinate clause's head and that the head must be an argument with a sufficient number of agent-like properties.",0
"The present work studies the grammatical properties of Spanish time constructions involving hacer 'make' from an empirical, quantitative perspective with insights from both competence and language use. The results show a big difference between the properties of the so-called clausal and adverbial constructions, something unnoticed until now. Whereas hacer, in the
former, has properties not significantly different from other verbs, in the latter, it shows a strong erosion of its verbal and clausal properties like TAM morphology, negation, time adjunction or word order freedom. This contradicts earlier contributions to the topic and argues against those formal proposals positing a synchronic derivational relation between the two constructions.",0
"This paper presents the hypothesis that words (and not morphemes) are the minimal units of connection between sound and meaning in human languages. Such a proposal implies the definition of the word as a categorized syntactic derivation that is linked in memory to a representation in the sensorimotor system. The main implications of the hypothesis are the following: (i) A non-lexicalist model is compatible with the phenomena of lexical integrity and lack of productivity that motivate lexicalist models. (ii) It can be concluded that bound morphemes (roots and affixes) are neither syntactic nor conceptual entities, but purely morpho-phonological ones. Morphemes are side effects of linguistic change operating as resources to optimize the processing and memorization of words. And (iii) a neo-constructionist conception of words is made compatible with a paradigmatic morphology.",0
"Simpson and Wu (2002) analyze Chinese shi-de constructions and propose a
new type of grammaticalization in the Minimalist framework called 'lateral' grammaticalization (LG). It is compared with Roberts and Roussou (R&R) (2003) and van Gelderen's (2004, 2011) Minimalist analyses of grammaticalization (henceforth 'standard' grammaticalization (SG)) and
while both display 'structural simplification', as defined by R&R (2003:198-201) and van Gelderen (2011:13-21), LG does not display 'upward feature analysis', which is a diagnostic trait of SG (R&R (2003:200)). Rather, there is 'lateral feature analysis' where one functional category (e.g. D) is re-analysed as another (e.g. T) (S&W (2002:201-202)).Furthermore, while examples of SG regularly display semantic and morphophonological weakening (R&R (2003:218-229)), those of LG do not, which seems to suggest that 'upward feature analysis', not 'lateral feature analysis', is the cause behind weakening in grammaticalization. Bybee (2003, 2011) proposes that frequency is the main driving force behind weakening in grammaticalization, since as the grammaticalizing element undergoes weakening in semantics, it becomes compatible with a wider range of complements and hence rises in frequency which causes it to become automatised and lose morphophonological substance. There is therefore a causal relationship between semantic and morphophonological weakening ('parallel reduction hypothesis'/'co-evolution of meaning and substance' (Bybee et al (1994:17-21)). In my comparison between the Romance future (Latin infinitive + habere) (SG) and the Chinese copula shi (LG), it is discovered that 'upward feature analysis' in SG does indeed give rise to 'context expansion', namely a widening in the range of complementation (cf Bybee (2003)), which leads to rise in frequency and morphophonological weakening, while 'lateral feature analysis' in LG crucially leads to 'context reduction' which lowers the frequency of the grammaticalizing element and hence pre-empts its morphophonological weakening. Cross-linguistic patterns of weakening are examined and there seems to be a correlation between frequency effects in syntactic change and the rate of morphophonological weakening in functional elements. This is significant, since it is widely assumed that functional elements are necessarily weak (cf Selkirk (1984:335-337)) when the evidence from a formal analysis of grammaticalization suggests that the empirical properties of functional elements, namely their differential rates of weakening, can (and should) be derived from their genesis, namely grammaticalization (SG/LG). This opens up new research questions which are left for future investigations.",1
"Certain psych constructions may be formed on a regular pattern across languages, that of a psychological predicate or phrase having a physical predicate as a ""root"" and not a psych one. Those constructions may be words, like some Ving and Vant adjectives in English and French, and they may be phrasal, like the desiderative construction in Finnish (Pylkkänen 2000a), among others. Here, we mostly study the adjectives, such as marrant 'funny', jaw-dropping and effing. They are [ [ Vphy ] ing ]psychA phy-inside-psych constructs which literally mean 'which causes the physical effect usually triggered by the emotion/sensation that it causes', and actually mean 'which causes that emotion/sensation', a psych meaning. They are exceptional because, contrary to all other Ving forms, they do not mean 'which Vs'. They mean 'which causes (one) to V'. In this unexpected meaning, these forms introduce their own cause participant, which will lead us to investigate the syntax of Object Experiencer morphological and syntactic constructions.",0
"Noting that 'I-words' in Rasta Talk (e.g. Iquality ""equality"", Irits ""spirits"", Iration ""creation"", Irous ""desirous"", Yood ""food"", Yook ""cook"") bear certain similarities to lexical blends, I provide an Optimality Theoretical analysis of the process of Iformation (creating 'I-words').

In the speech of Rastafarians in Jamaica and elsewhere, Iformation is a salient process by which the first syllable of a word is replaced by /aɪ̯/ or /j/. Generally polysyllabic words adopt the former strategy and monosyllables the latter, but many exceptions to this generalisation exist---as well other unexpected forms like Iration ""creation"", Irous ""desirous"" are found. 

Like lexical blending, Iformation typically involve outputs with same stress pattern and syllable count as primary source form. Additionally, both blends and Iformation takes both take advantage of fortuitous overlaps of phonological material, even where this affects the syllable count;  e.g. ""croiSSANdwich""
(rather than *""croiwich""); cp. ""Irous"" 'desirous' (rather than *""Isirous"").

Following on the substantial work on blending within the OT framework, this paper develops an OT analysis of the Rasta Talk process of Iformation.",0
"The goal of this paper is two-fold. It presents a cross-linguistic survey of non-local allomorphy and it develops a formal model that accounts for the observed patterns. The survey reveals that local and non-local allomorphy occupy two opposing sides of a markedness scale: local allomorphy is unmarked, while non-local allomorphy is marked and exceptional. Also, the distance between the trigger and target of allomorphy in non-local patterns is much more conservative than expected. We develop a model of allomorphy, where the markedness split in locality stems from an ECONOMY condition of the PF-interface.",0
"The paper takes a look at denominal verbs in English and Romanian  which can be paraphrased by means of the verb give, and argues that the verb GIVE cannot incorporate. On the one hand, GIVE is not a primitive in the lexico-semantic representation of verbs, on the other hand, incorporating a noun into the null verb GIVE would generate both syntactic and semantic problems.The paper takes the non-primitivity of GIVE as support in favour of the view that that one needs to clearly distinguish between paraphrases and the actual lexical semantic representation of denominals, and argues for the alternative of nominal root incorporation before the selection of arguments.",0
"Reflexive verbs in Modern Hebrew show specific morphological marking: only one of the seven verbal templates in the language can be used for reflexives. Yet this morphological marking also appears on anticausative verbs, which have different syntactic and semantic properties. I provide an analysis of reflexivity in Hebrew which does not make reference to dedicated reflexive morphosyntax. By combining independently needed functional heads, the proposal explains what in the syntax underlies this morphology and how different kinds of verbs end up with identical morphophonological properties. To this end, I consider the lexical semantics of individual lexical roots as well as the syntactic configurations in which roots and arguments are embedded. The resulting theory is one in which lexical roots trigger specific interpretations of the syntax at the interfaces.",0
"This paper inquires into two issues of Hungarian PPs. Firstly, when Hungarian pronouns bear an oblique case, the case marker must be followed by possessive agreement. Secondly, this pronoun-case-agreement order contrasts with the order found in garden variety possessive structures: ordinary possessive DPs feature the order noun-agreement-case. The goal of this paper is to offer an account of these puzzling phenomena. I argue that a PP structure in which PPs are projected from a silent place noun and the Ground is merged as the possessor of place (Terzi, 2005, 2008, 2010; Botwinik-Rotem, 2008; Botwinik-Rotem and Terzi, 2008; Pantcheva, 2008; Cinque, 2010a; Noonan, 2010, and Nchare and Terzi, 2014) allows an elightening analysis of the appearance and position of the possessive agreement in PPs. I also discuss how certain surface differences between PPs and ordinary possessive constructions can be accounted for while maintaining the possessive analysis of PPs. By showing that a PP structure with a possessive core yields a natural account of the intricate Hungarian data, the paper strengthens the case for a possessive-based approach to PPs in Universal Grammar.",0
"In this short review, I discuss briefly the historical development of the Word as used in the generative tradition, critically evaluating arguments that it is a syntactic atom.  I will proceed to outline an alternative, in which the syntactic building blocks are functional terminals, functors.  In that alternative, functors combine with roots, where 'Root' denotes a primarily phonological unit which is, on its own, both syntactically and semantically inert.  A word, within such an approach, is a phonological domain with fixed, language-specific properties (e.g. the domain of primary stress in English), which may correspond to syntactic and semantic constituents of variable complexity.  The picture, as a whole, has ramifications not only for the construction of words and syntactic phrases, but also for the interface between phonological representations, syntactic representations, and the nature of listedness for (so-called) lexical meaning.",0
"Only few grammatical theories can faithfully incorporate cumulative
effects. In optimality theory, two different means have been suggested
to account for cumulativity of constraint interaction, viz., local
constraint conjunction and harmonic grammar. The present paper
considers cumulative effects in morphology (with differential argument
encoding) and syntax (with long-distance extraction) and shows that
existing analyses in terms of local constraint conjunction cannot be
transferred to harmonic grammar analyses:
Whereas cumulative constraint interaction can be selectively switched
off in local conjunction analyses, this is impossible  for principled
reasons in harmonic grammar analyses. Consequently, even though
harmonic grammar is explicitly designed to capture cumulative effects,
it turns out that this approach is systematically unable to derive 
a certain kind of cumulativity because it cannot prevent unwanted
concurrent cumulative interaction, a property that I refer to as the 
Circe (Cumulative Interaction Resulting from
Constraint Equivalence) problem.",0
"A combination of antisymmetry plus reduced movement options for adjectives in the context of very small phrases is capable of providing an account of the fact that English has prefixal 'un-', rather than suffixal 'un-'.  If English is in this respect typical, then the proposed account will have universal validity.
     A key component of this account is that antisymmetry extends to what we think of as morphology, leading to a necessary asymmetry between prefixes and suffixes, with the latter unable to asymmetrically c-command an associated stem.",0
"This paper compares the partial/exhaustive control distinction in Russian, Icelandic and European Portuguese and argues that all three share a common core: genuine partial control readings are only possible where PRO has case. An analyses of these patterns is outlines whereby partial control involves agreement with pro in the edge of a lower phase. New evidence is presented for this analysis based on negative controllers.",0
"Using data from agreement in three Algonquian languages (Ojibwe, Cheyenne, and Plains Cree), this squib shows that effects typically attributed to Chomsky's (2000, 2001) Activity Condition (AC) can vary not only across languages, as in Baker's (2008b) macroparametric proposal, but within a language as well. AC effects are thus another instance in which an apparent macroparameter turns out, on closer inspection, to be a microparameter instead, as in prominent cases such as the Pro-Drop Parameter and the Polysynthesis Parameter (Kayne 2005; Baker 2008a).",0
"Consonant cluster simplification in Tundra Nenets coexists with other consonantal alternations, such as fricative strengthening, lenition of stops, and a variety of NC-effects, which all apply within the same phrasal domain. These processes interact with each other, suggesting an opaque ordering within the same post-lexical domain and thus presenting a challenge not only for inherently parallel theories like classical Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky 2004), but also for the cyclic derivational approaches such as Stratal OT (Kiparsky 2000; Bermúdez-Otero 2011). We analyze all instances of Tundra Nenets cluster simplification as coalescence and show that a variety of apparently opaque alternations accompanying cluster simplification can be seen as transparent on this account. We also argue that strengthening in consonant clusters is caused by an intermediate stage where coda obstruents lose their place and turn into a glottal stop.",0
"Attributive adjectives have a number of properties that distinguish them from predicative adjectives and other modifiers of the noun. For example, attributives are subject to ordering restrictions that do not apply to other types of nominal modifier, and they exhibit scope interactions unlike predicatives or relative clauses. This thesis argues that these properties are best captured by an analysis in which all attributives share the same relationship with the noun and discusses the ways in which our understanding of a number of phenomena at the edges of attribution must change.

One influential theory of adjective ordering restrictions (discussed in Larson 2000a and Cinque 2010, among others) holds that violations of the ordering hierarchy that applies to many attributive adjectives are due to the existence of modifiers that superficially look like attributives but are in fact derived from reduced relative clauses. These derived attributives are merged higher than underived attributives and are unordered with respect to each other. I show that the offending adjectives do not behave syntactically like true relative clauses, whether full or reduced. In addition, while all attributive semantics is asymmetric, true relatives involve symmetric modification. This single-source approach entails a rethinking of some of the effects commonly understood to result from attribution. I will address two such effects, which could be taken as evidence in favour of a derived attributive approach to attribution, and show that they are best analyzed using a homogeneous approach to attribution. 

In languages where the noun follows its modifiers, the ordering of AP and PP modifiers is free and their scope varies with c-command. In noun-initial languages their order is fixed, with the AP preceding other modifiers, and their scope is ambiguous. This pattern could be taken as evidence for a second source of adnominal modification, if the high position of the AP in noun-final languages is a reduced relative clause. However, I show that both the ordering and scope effects are due to a novel constraint restricting the linear order of attributive and other modifiers. The ordering patterns of AP and PP modifiers are therefore not evidence for the existence of derived attributives.  

One piece of evidence for the dual-source theory of attribution is that some adjectives have unexpectedly rigid requirements for adjacency and nonintersectivity (for example, in the phrase 'hard worker'). I demonstrate that  cases like these are not true attribution but are instead a type of bracketing paradox. I argue that these bracketing paradoxes are derived by movement at LF. This movement (and indeed all movement) is restricted in the type of information that must be retained before and after the operation takes place, but is otherwise free. Therefore, these examples do not provide evidence for two different types of attributive modifier. 

The proposed analysis of attribution allows for a simplification of adjectival modification, as it does not require a distinction between derived and underived attributive adjectives. The analysis presented in this thesis entails a novel categorization of certain adjectival phenomena, but readily accounts for the empirical intricacies of attribution.",1
"The goal of this paper is to investigate the polysemy of Spanish spatial prepositions (a, en, hacia, among others), and offer a syntactic and semantic treatment of this phenomenon. The core idea behind this account is that these prepositions can denote sets of possible locations that are involved in spatial relations. Consequently, the compositional interaction of polysemous prepositions with other parts of speech can determine which specific sense emerges in a sentence. The analysis is couched in a Type-Logical Grammar approach. It addresses data that have not previously been analysed in the literature, involving so-called Boolean constructions (e.g. en la estación y la calle). Also, the paper shows that a single treatment can capture all the relevant data. Therefore, the analysis shows that polysemy is a grammar phenomenon that is better accounted for in architectures with a distinct syntactic/derivational component (e.g. Distributed Morphology), than in architectures lacking this component (e.g. Cognitive Linguistics approaches). Consequences for a theory of grammar are discussed.",0
"Sentences containing 'wherewithal' have a richer syntax than might at first glance be apparent. This richer syntax provides a handle on the absence of various potential words such as *whatwithal, *whenwithal, *herewithal, *therewithal, *wherewithwhole, *wherewithhalf, *wherewithalmostal, *wherewithboth that an approach associated with a less rich syntax could not provide.",0
"This paper deals with a so-far unnoticed phenomenon in prosodic phonology, which we dub prosodic smothering. Prosodic smothering arises when the prosodic status of a clitic or affix varies with the presence or absence of some outer morpheme. We first illustrate prosodic smothering with novel data from two genetically unrelated languages, Macedonian (Slavic) and Kaqchikel (Mayan). We then provide a unified account of prosodic smothering based on a principled extension of the theory of prosodic subcategorization (Inkelas 1990, Peperkamp 1997, Chung 2003, Yu 2003, Paster 2006, Bye 2007, among others). Prosodic subcategorization typically involves requirements placed on items to the left or the right of the selecting morpheme. We show that prosodic smothering naturally emerges in a theory which also allows for subcategorization in the vertical dimension, such that morphemes may select for the prosodic category which immediately dominates them in surface prosodic structure. This extension successfully reduces two apparent cases of non-local prosodic conditioning to the effects of strictly local prosodic selection.",0
"This book explores a key issue in linguistic theory, the systematic variation in form between semantic equivalents across languages. Two contrasting views of the role of lexical meaning in the analysis of such variation can be found in the literature: (i) uniformity, whereby lexical meaning is universal, and variation arises from idiosyncratic differences in the inventory and phonological shape of language-particular functional material, and (ii) transparency, whereby systematic variation in form arises from systematic variation in the meaning of basic lexical items. 

In this volume, Itamar Francez and Andrew Koontz-Garboden contrast these views as applied to the empirical domain of property concept sentences - sentences expressing adjectival predication and their translational equivalents across languages. They demonstrate that property concept sentences vary systematically between possessive and predicative form, and propose a transparentist analysis of this variation that links it to the lexical denotations of basic property concept lexemes. At the heart of the analysis are qualities: mass-like model theoretic objects that closely resemble scales. The authors contrast their transparentist analysis with uniformitarian alternatives, demonstrating its theoretical and empirical advantages. They then show that the proposed theory of qualities can account for interesting and novel observations in two central domains of grammatical theory: the theory of syntactic categories, and the theory of mass nouns. The overall results highlight the importance of the lexicon as a locus of generalizations about the limits of crosslinguistic variation.",0
"We argue that the comparative head that enters into the morphological makeup of the comparative (Bobaljik 2012) is to be split up into two distinct heads (Caha 2016). Evidence for this claim comes from Czech comparative morphology, root suppletion, and the interaction of Czech suppletion with negation. We further argue that the account for root suppletion that we provide captures the data better than a DM account.",0
"It has been held for some time that languages may show a divergence in their case and agreement alignment patterns. It is possible for a language to have an ergative-absolutive case alignment, but apparently nominative-accusative agreement, while nominative-accusative case with ergative-absolutive agreement is claimed to be unattested (Dixon, 1994). Proposed explanations of this universal (Bobaljik, 2008, Baker, 2008, 2015, Legate, 2008) exist and have implications for theories of case. This brief note defends the validity of the universal against
alleged counter-examples in the recent literature (Wunderlich, 2012, Deal, 2015). The most striking apparent counter-examples are from Indo-Aryan (Magier, 1983), but turn out to rest on a conflation of differential object marking and accusative case. When the two are kept distinct (as I argue they must be), the counter-examples disappear, and the apparently challenging cases are seen to be the combination of two factors that must each be admitted in their own right.",0
"This paper explores the nature of core-oblique distinctions in some Austronesian languages of Indonesia, focusing on the intermediate status between core and oblique categories. It proposes a core index, a novel method to determine the core status of an argument. Core index evidence shows that there is a cline running from syntactically core to non-core (oblique). The proposed core-index-based analysis allows us to claim syntactic transitivity with confidence and to resolve successfully the controversial transitivity problem of the Indonesian bare verb construction. The analysis advances our understanding of the nature of semi-core arguments, syntactic transitivity, symmetricality of voice system, and alternative argument realisations, not only in Indonesian and Balinese, but also in other typologically different Austronesian languages of central and eastern Indonesia and beyond. Importantly, the core-index study also provides a means for cross-linguistic comparative analysis of the unusual alternative pattern of applicativisation whereby no core promotion is involved. The paper also discusses how the gradient nature of the core-oblique distinction, particularly semi-coreness of arguments, poses a challenge for any theory that posits discrete classes of relations.",0
"Auxiliary verbs are known to grammaticalize from lexical verbs, but how do lexical
verbs acquire verbal complements to begin with? This article provides a pragmatic
account of the grammaticalization of a Spanish anterior from a lexical source
construction meaning FINISH. We argue that verbs meaning FINISH are lexically
unsaturated, with an event variable that must be assigned a value, whether implicitly by
inference or explicitly by a verbal complement. In our data, overt lexical verb
complements are initially motivated by informativity; the infinitive is used to describe an
event that is unexpected. This original constructional meaning is gradually lost due to a
process of overtification; the use of the infinitive increases in contexts in which the
event is not unexpected. The subsequent development of the temporal meaning is
motivated by the failure of listeners to accommodate too-costly presuppositions in a
particular syntactic context, triggering the reanalysis of the constructional meaning.",0
"This paper investigates the shared case patterns in causative and ditransitive constructions across Philippine-type Formosan languages and demonstrates how they motivate a nominative-accusative analysis for the Philippine-type voice system. With novel data from Puyuma, Amis, and Seediq, I argue that (i) pivot-marking in Philippine-type languages is better analyzed as a marker of information structure status (topic), rather than the reflex of structural absolutive ominative Case, and (ii) Philippine-type voice affixes are better analyzed as A'-agreement markers, rather than transitivity/applicative marking. Last, I discuss how the agreement approach to voice affixes offers a unitary account for the lack of noun/verb distinction in Philippine-type languages.",0
"Adopting a constructionist approach, this paper articulates a proposal about how syntax encodes the fundamental parameters of noun lexical semantics: entity type, part structure, atomicity, and numerosity, represented at different syntactic loci. It is claimed that the naming (not describing) of an entity type is what makes a noun a noun (formally, what turns a root into a noun). An 'entity type' is understood as an e-type element in the speaker's ontology, not yet determined as denoting over kinds or their object instances. Higher projections turn this into a predicate, and further grammatical specifications may restrict its reference to what is modelled as elements of a partition, or as atoms, but without a single countability switch. Whether the reference is to kinds or to instances depends on all the specifications that jointly define a division of reference. In particular, plurality enforces an instance reading where the partition it determines is based on spatiotemporally situated parts, in the absence of other criteria for individuality. Beside determining what types of plurals may not license a kind reading, this view of the division of reference analyzes fake mass nouns ('furniture') as a count structure inside a mass shell, which predictively relates their semantics to their morphology. The same analytical framework, with no additional stipulations, explains the properties of non-countable plural nouns, both arising from mass nouns ('waters') and from non-nominal bases ('beginnings'). Finally, a case of mixed-gender DP shows that unexpected interactions between gender and number can be interpreted as cases where the determination of an agreement class is bound up with the determination of part structure.",0
"The squib analyses an asymmetry concerning the availability of V-to-C movement with different Romanian finite (the imperative) and non-finite (the gerund) verbal forms in the presence of clausal negation: with imperatives negation blocks V-to-C movement, while with gerunds it does not. We show that it is not the projection of clausal negation per se that blocks V-to-C movement. Rather, the nature of the clausal negators selected (full word vs. affix) is responsible the verb movement asymmetry depicted.",0
"We provide an analysis of focus and exhaustive focus in the Grassfields Bantu language Awing. We show that Awing provides an exceptionally clear window into the syntactic properties of exhaustive focus. Our analysis reveals that the Awing particle LE realizes a left-peripheral head which, in terms of its syntactic position in the functional sequence, closely corresponds to the Foc(us) head in standard cartographic analyses (e.g. Rizzi 1997). Crucially, however, we show that LE is only used if the focus it associates with receives a presuppositional exhaustive (cleft-like) interpretation. Other types of focus are not formally encoded in Awing. In order to reflect this semantic specification of LE, we call its syntactic category Exh rather than Foc. Another point of difference from what one would consider a ""standard"" cartographic Foc head is that the focus associated with LE is not realized in its specifier but rather within its complement. More particularly, we argue that LE associates with the closest maximal projection it asymmetrically c-commands. The broader theoretical relevance of the present work is at least two-fold. First, our paper offers novel evidence in support of Horvath's (2010) Strong Modularity Hypothesis for Discourse Features, according to which information structural notions such as focus cannot be represented in narrow syntax as formal features. We argue that the information structure-related movement operations that Awing exhibits can be accounted for by interface considerations, in the spirit of Reinhart (2006). Second, our data support the generality of the so called closeness requirement on association with focus Jacobs (1983), which dictates that a focus-sensitive particle be as close to its focus as possible (in terms of c-command). What is of special significance is the fact that Awing exhibits two different avenues to satisfying closeness. The standard one - previously described for German or Vietnamese and witnessed here for the Awing particle TSOE 'only' - relies primarily on the flexible attachment of the focus-sensitive particle. The Awing particle LE, in contrast, is syntactically rigid. For that reason, the satisfaction of closeness relies solely on the flexibility of other syntactic constituents.",1
"An assumption that is shared by the syntactic (Baker, 1988, Ouhalla, 1991 a.o.) and the lexicalist (Lieber, 1980 a.o.) approaches to morphology is that the morphological identity of a grammatical object is to be found in its lexical entry as idiosyncratic information. Whether a grammatical object is an affix, or a clitic, or a prefix is something that is idiosyncratically indicated for each morpheme in its lexical entry. However, certain generalizations about the morphology of some grammatical objects suggest that an alternative way of thinking about the identity of morphological objects is needed. It seems to be the case that (at least) some grammatical objects have the morphological identity they do because of the syntactic configuration they must appear in. With this background, in this paper, we claim that a topic marker or a focus sensitive particle cannot be an affix. This follows from two assumptions: (1) the projections of the topic or focus(sensitive) heads cannot form head-chains with their complement and (2) affixhood is the interpretation (i.e. the spell-out) of head adjunction. We conclude that affixhood should not be taken to be a primitive concept of the linguistic analysis.",0
"In this paper, we review and investigate verbal argument structures in Japanese, especially transitivity alternations where transitive-intransitive verb ""pairs"" (e.g. mawa-s-u vs. mawa-r-u, 'turn') have been exclusively analyzed with mixed results in favor of both lexical (Miyagawa, 1984; Jacobsen, 1992) and syntactic (Miyagawa, 1998; Nishiyama, 1998) strands. Empirically, we closely examine hitherto unexplored verb ""triplets"" (Suga, 1980; de Chene, 2016), in which the same lexical roots are shared by multiple transitive/intransitive verbs with different transitivity morphology, and reveal their differential syntactic behaviors in the interpretation of external arguments (between multiple transitive verbs sharing the same root) and unaccusativity (between multiple intransitive verbs sharing the same root). Theoretically, within the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz, 1993), we propose the system in which transitivity morphology, previously identified as little v (Volpe, 2005; Harley, 2008; Marantz, 2013), is analyzed as Voice morphology differently specified regarding the presence/absence of external arguments (Schafer, 2008; Marantz, 2013; Wood, 2015; Alexiadou et al., 2015), and explain the syntax of transitivity alternations. Furthermore, the proposed Voice system will be extended to the broader empirical domain of Japanese argument structures and derive ditransitive verbs, ""figure ditransitive"" verbs, and syntactic causatives/passives. Finally, we discuss several theoretical consequences of our proposal concerning (i) lexical vs. syntactic approaches to argument structure, (ii) the distinctness of Voice and little v (Harley, 2013; Legate, 2014), and (iii) the unification of argument-introducing functional heads under i* (Wood & Marantz, 2017).",0
"This paper uses techniques from mathematical linguistics to explain and unify a variety of typological gaps in morphology and morphosyntax. In particular, I show how both the *ABA generalization and the limited number of attested Person Case Constraints follow from graph-theoretic restrictions on how locality hierarchies may be constructed.

The central assumption is that each morphological domain (person, number, case, etc.) has a fixed base hierarchy, and each language may alter these base hierarchies in a narrowly restricted fashion: a language-specific hierarchy is permitted only if it can be obtained from the base hierarchy by a weakly non-inverting graph-transduction. I show that weakly non-inverting graph-transductions are particularly simple from a computational perspective, and consequently the typological gaps follow from general simplicity desiderata.",0
"We present an experimental study (off-line acceptability rating task) conduced with native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, Finnish and Italian to verify syntactic constraints on the possessive pronoun-antecedence relation in full pro-drop languages (Italian) and partial pro-drop (Brazilian Portuguese and Finnish). The goal of the investigation was to examine the hypothesis that in full pro-drop languages, null pronouns, as well as overt pronouns, are subject to principle B, although they display a preference for local c-commanding antecedents, while in partial pro-drop languages, they respond to principle A, requiring a local c-commanding antecedent. Three factors were manipulated: type of possessive pronoun (overt vs. null), syntactic configuration regulating the intra-sentential relation between the pronoun and its antecedent (locality and c-command), the interpretation assigned to the pronoun (anaphoric, non-anaphoric and exophoric). The results suggests that the hypothesis is correct, although a significant difference among BP and Finnish was found, showing that Finns has less acceptance of non-anaphoric readings for null pronouns. As for overt pronouns, the picture is more complex, showing differences between languages and conditions. This might reflect interface issues related to recovering and evaluating antecedents.",0
"This paper analyzes a case-marking alternation seen in the standard Estonian numeral-noun construction and pseudopartitive construction (e.g., tükk leiba 'a piece of bread'). In nominative and accusative contexts, the second noun (N2) is marked with partitive case while the first noun umeral (N1) is marked with the case of the pseudopartitive. In all other case contexts both nouns must bear the case of the pseudopartitive. I propose that the partitive case on N2 is an unmarked case in the sense of Baker (2015) and Marantz (1991), among others. It is assigned to complements of nouns that do not already have a case value. This derives the case-marking alternation as a matter of timing: nominative and accusative are assigned too late to affect case-marking internal to the pseudopartitive. I show that pseudopartitives are not amenable to an analysis in terms of case-stacking as has been proposed for similar phenomena. The analysis presented here also extends to collocations of numerals and pseudopartitives in Estonian. I also show how the analysis can be extended to account for differences between Finnish and Estonian, and I suggest a typology of pseudopartitive-marking predicted by the analysis I propose. The analysis has implications for case realization and assignment as well as pseudopartitive and DP structure.",0
"Existing work has sought to explain the Algonquian person hierarchy (SAP>X>3>3'>0) in terms of the geometry of person features. This paper identifies problems for the feature-geometric approach and proposes that the hierarchy instead reflects the structural size of the nominal categories: first and second persons are PhiP, impersonal X is DefP, proximate third persons are DP, and obviative third persons are KP. Each successive layer of nominal structure makes the person features in PhiP less accessible to an external agreement probe. The person hierarchy thus reduces to an effect of minimality: the hierarchy is simply a statement of the amount of nominal structure that intervenes between a probe and the person features in PhiP. This approach does away with the need for stipulated feature geometries and ties the person hierarchy directly to the well-established phrasal syntax of nominals.",1
"Using quantitative corpus evidence from different periods, the present paper analyzes the emergence and diachronic development of the Spanish time constructions (clausal and adverbial) involving contemporary hacer 'make' and earlier haber 'have'. The obtained data, as well as cross-linguistic evidence, suggest that the clausal construction must have been the source of the adverbial one. A proposal is presented that could explain that development. The data show, in addition, that the grammatical properties and usage patterns of the clausal and adverbial constructions were very similar until the 16th century but have been diverging ever since. This divergence coincides with an exponential increase in the textual raw frequency of the adverbial construction, where word order fixation, erosion of the inflectional morphology and a change in the possibilities for time adjunction among others are found to occur at around the same time. This points towards a desentencialization, loss of inner structure and grammaticalization of the adverbial construction in those periods.",0
"This paper investigates the structure and development of two unique morphological (word-building) processes found in Rastafari English [RE]: ""overstandings"", e.g. forms like outformer, livicate etc.; and ""I-words"" like ital, Issembly, inity etc.

I show that these two RE morphological phenomena are distinct from any processes previously identified in other languages, both in terms of form and function. Overstandings like downpress (< oppress, treated as if composed of up + press) superficially resemble folk etymology, in which a morphologically-opaque word is re-analysed; e.g. woodchuck (< Algonquian otchek), shamefaced (< earlier English shamefast ``stuck in shame''). The process of folk etymology, however, involves a misunderstanding of the original sense triggering a reformation, while overstandings involve an intentional re-etymologising where the change in form reflects change in meaning and/or perspective. That is, the standard English is treated as representing a lower, incomplete understanding, whereas the new RE form signals a higher comprehension (i.e. overstanding). Many overstandings are formed on the basis of binary oppositions like up vs. down, over vs. under, dead vs. (a)live, love vs. hate etc. (reflecting an ideological binarity lexicalised by Zion vs. Babylon).

I-words involve a transformational process replacing initial syllables by the diphthong /ai/, thus Iration for creation. The underlying process involved seems historically connected to the restructuring of the RE pronominal system, which not only eliminates me in favour of I for all grammatical case forms, but also largely eschews the use of the second person form you (often replaced by the I). Not only is ``you'' replaced, but also other phonological sequences yu, thus I-man (/aiman/) from human (Jamaican Creole /yuman/), and similarly forms like inity, iniverse, and that from this point the process was eventually generalised to include the replacement of any initial syllable by /ai/.",0
"Event nominalizations and agent nominalizations provide evidence that all affixation is morphological, and that phrasal categories are projected from words in the syntax. Departing from both transformational and earlier lexicalist approaches to nominalizations, I first argue on the basis of English and Finnish evidence that gerunds are not DPs built on heads that embed an extended verbal projection (Baker & Vinokurova 2009, Kornfilt & Whitman 2011), but IPs that need Case. They are categorially verbal at all levels of the syntax, including having structural subjects rather than possessor specifiers. Their nominal behavior is entirely due to the unvalued Case feature borne by their Infl head, which they share with all participial verb forms. I then argue that agent nominalizations are categorially nominal at all levels of the syntax, and that the verb-like case assignment of transitive agent nominalizations is due to the verbal Aspect feature borne by their nominalizing head. Vedic Sanskrit, Northern Paiute, and Sakha evidence is shown to favor this analysis over B&V's analysis of intransitive agent nominalizations as nominal equivalents of Voice heads and of transitive agent nominalizations as nominal equivalents of Aspect heads. The two ""mixed"" categories –-- gerunds and transitive nominalizations –-- thus prove to be formally duals in that they are respectively verbs with Case and nouns with Aspect.",0
"This paper provides an analysis of a wide range of morpho-syntactic phenomena in the verbal complex in an Algonquian language Arapaho. The focus of this study is on a process widely spread in Algonquian languages and known in the literature as Initial Change (IC). In this paper, I argue that IC is a morpheme, specifically an infix, and that its distribution is best explained by positing that the morpheme marks [+realis] mood. The major theoretical claim of this study is the following. IC, being the [+realis] morpheme in Arapaho, appears in a high functional projection in the clause, namely C; it is analyzed as the spell-out of C[+realis]. As such, it competes for this position with a number of morphemes belonging to the CP domain in the language. I will argue that the competition for the C head is driven by the structural properties of the verbal morphology rather than by specific features expressed by the competing morphemes. More specifically, I will suggest that Arapaho is a simple CP language, meaning that only one C head can be present in a clause at a time.",0
"Research in speakers of closely related varieties has shown that bilectalism and non-standardization affect speakers' perception of the variants that exist in their native languages in a way that is absent from the performance of their monolingual peers. One possible explanation for this difference is that non-standardization blurs the boundaries of grammatical variants and increases grammatical fluidity. Affected by such factors, bilectals become less accurate in identifying the variety to which a grammatical variant pertains. Another explanation is that their differential performance derives from the fact that they are competent in two varieties. Under this scenario, the difference is due to the existence of two linguistic systems in the course of development, and not to how close or standardized these systems are. This study employs a novel variety-judgment task in order to elucidate which of the two explanations holds. Having administered the task to monolinguals, bilectals, and bilinguals, including heritage language learners and L1 attriters, we obtained a dataset of 16,245 sentences. The analysis shows differential performance between bilectal and bilingual speakers, granting support for the first explanation. We discuss the role of factors such as non-standardization and linguistic proximity in language development and flesh out the implications of the results in relation to different developmental trajectories.",1
"Quotation is a means that is used to point to linguistic shapes. An instance are name-mentioning constructions involving 'sogenannt' in German as in 'sogenannte Sepsis' ('so-called sepsis'). The present paper examines two distinct interpretations a 'sogenannt'-construction can adopt. In contrast to 'Sepsis', a noun like 'Hotel', for example, as in 'sogenanntes Hotel' ('so-called hotel') gives rise to a ""distanced"" interpretation of the construction rather than one informing about a concept's name. A unitary semantic analysis will be proposed for 'sogenannt', where the individual readings emerge from an interplay between lexical factors like the head nominal's establishedness, on the one hand, and pragmatic implicatures rooted in relevance- as well as manner-based principles, on the other. From a compositional perspective, the 'so' in 'sogenannt' will be reasoned to be identical in function to quotation marks as a means to refer to a linguistic shape through demonstration. The different interpretations of the construction will be coupled with the type of binding of the agent-argument variable as well as the event variable of the verbal root 'nenn-' ('call') of 'sogenannt'.",0
"This article argues for the novel understanding of minimalist Merge as a special case of extended Rewriting Rules which allow more than one elementary symbol on the left side of the arrow.  This makes it possible to extend the use of Rewriting Rules to Distributed Morphology and, possibly, even to phonology.",0
"Based on the distribution of bound (fake) indexicals in four Germanic languages this paper argues that binding is not sensitive to functional heads as postulated in many current Agree approaches to binding. Instead data are provided that argue for a return to the traditional view that binding requires a direct dependency between the antecedent and the variable. I suggest that the agreement properties and restrictions on bound indexicals as well as (so far attested) cross-linguistic differences in the availability of bound indexicals are accounted for in a Reverse Agree model (Wurmbrand 2012, 2014) which incorporates a locality condition reminiscent of Rule H (Heim 1993, Fox 1998) favoring feature sharing (Pesetsky and Torrego 2007) with the closest relevant antecedent, as well as certain (markedness inspired) morphological feature co-occurrence restrictions.",0
"A recent debate in the morphological literature concerns the status of derivational affixes. While some linguists (Marantz 1997, 2001; Marvin 2003) consider derivational affixes a type of functional morpheme that realizes a categorial head, others (Lowenstamm 2015; De Belder 2011) argue that derivational affixes are roots. Our proposal, which finds its empirical basis in a study of Dutch derivational affixes, takes a middle position. We argue that there are two types of derivational affixes: some derivational affixes are roots (i.e. lexical morphemes) while others are categorial heads (i.e. functional morphemes). Affixes that are roots show 'flexible' categorial behavior, are subject to 'lexical' phonological rules, and may trigger idiosyncratic meanings. Affixes that realize categorial heads, on the other hand, are categorially rigid, do not trigger 'lexical' phonological rules nor allow for idiosyncrasies in their interpretation.",0
"The paper focuses on a wide range of structures in which head-initial structure co-occurs with one or more final particles. Superficially, structures of this type - which are very commonly attested cross-linguistically - violate the Final-over-Final Condition (previously, the Final-over-Final Constraint; see i.a. Biberauer, Holmberg, Roberts 2008, 2014, Sheehan 2013). Here I start with an overview of the types of apparently FOFC-violating structures found in the particle domain. Thereafter, I introduce the formal configurations that would give rise to superficially FOFC-violating structures without actually violating the version of this Condition in Biberauer, Holmberg & Roberts (2014), i.e. that which, crucially, references extended projections. All of these configurations are shown to exist. I conclude with consideration of what the particle-derived insights reveal about the nature of FOFC, and about the fractal make-up of human language more generally.",0
"Expressions like Eng. ago have been claimed to be among the most likely candidates for postposition cross-linguistically (Plank 2011: 457). It is often added that the reason for this must be diachronic. Despite previous contributions, however, (Haspelmath 1997: 87-101; Kurzon 2008), we still lack a quantitatively appropriate typological account of the expressions as well as an explanation of which diachronic developments give rise to these expressions. These are the main goals of the present article. Relying on a sample of 100 languages, it has been found that: (i) The structure instantiated in English by ago is far from universal and geographically unevenly distributed. (ii) These expressions are indeed predominantly postposed, which does not hold for their mirror images for the future. (iii) Evidence from etymology, patterns of polysemy and documented semantic extensions suggests that this asymmetry is the result of the different diachronic sources of past and future markers.",0
"This chapter considers potential accounts of FOFC based on processing in contrast with the syntactic or PF-interface accounts exported in other chapters of this book. Accounts based on Hawkins' (1994) Early Immediate Constituents and a generalised version of the Right Roof Constraint (Cecchetto 2013) are compared and contrasted and certain issues are raised with them. Finally an apparent parallel with the Onset Maximisation Principle in phonology is discussed. The conclusion is that purely processing-based accounts face certain problems but that (i) even if FOFC arises in the syntax or in its mapping to PF, the ultimate explanation may be processing-based (see also Abels and Neeleman 2012) and (ii) given the apparent similarity between FOFC and Onset Maximisation, no existing account is broad enough in its application.",0
"This paper develops a new, optimality-theoretic analysis of word-level stress assignment in Cupeño (Takic, Uto-Aztecan). I argue that primary stress is assigned to the leftmost lexically accented (i.e. stress-preferring) morpheme, else to the word's left edge. I contend that this analysis is simpler and better explains the Cupeño data than previous accounts (Alderete 1999, 2001a,b), which assume that special faithfulness constraints privilege the accentual properties of roots over those of other affixes. The typological implications of this renanalysis of Cupeño stress are then discussed; without empirical support from Cupeño, it is suggested that ""root faithfulness"" plays no role in determining word stress in lexical accent systems cross-linguistically.",0
"Differential Object Marking (DOM) is a common crosslinguistic phenomenon whereby
languages that have morphologically overt case-marking on objects only display this marking on a subset of objects, namely those that are high in definiteness or animacy. In this squib, we set out to accomplish two things: (i) We introduce new findings related to DOM with conjoined direct objects, revealing that many DOM languages allow asymmetric marking in coordinations when conjuncts are mismatched in terms of animacy/definiteness. In the sample we tested, 9 out of 11 languages from 5 different language families allow for asymmetric marking with the two conjuncts differing in case. (ii) We show that these findings deal a fatal blow to many popular (broadly) Minimalist accounts of DOM, namely, those that derive DOM via movement. Since coordination structures are robust islands, it can be shown that, at least in these 9 languages, movement cannot be a necessary condition for DOM. We discuss two possible lines of argumentation in order to maintain a movement-based analysis and we show that both of them should be refuted.",0

In this paper I bring new arguments against the morphological analysis of the Spurious Se Rule in Spanish (Bonet 1991, Nevins 2007, 2012, a.o). I show that both the dative clitic le and the spurious clitic se differ syntactically. These facts strongly argue against the existence of a morphological rule (i.e. impoverishment) mapping the dative clitic into the spurious one, leaving its syntax unaffected.",0
"A distinctive property of Bantu verbs is the division into two domains: a cluster of inflectional prefixes (INFL) and a lexical verb stem. This claim has been supported by a range of multidomain effects which single out INFL as an independent constituent. Such effects led to the hypothesis that INFL in Bantu is of the same category as auxiliary verbs found in auxiliary–participle constructions. This paper investigates syntactic, morphological and phonological complexity effects in Northern Ndebele verbs and concludes that INFL in this language cannot be treated as a type of auxiliary. This conclusion is reached through a detailed comparison of INFL and verbal auxiliaries, revealing striking asymmetries, syntactic and phonological, between the two. The autonomy of INFL is argued to be a reflex of how verbal morphology is organized into complex heads in Bantu languages. In particular, the boundary between INFL and V-stem is modeled as a boundary between complex syntactic heads, and is not indicative of compound-tense syntax.",0
"In this paper, we argue that Ese'eja demonstrates an initial three syllable window within which primary prominence must fall, a typologically rare metrical window (Caballero 2011). We illustrate how this window interacts in complex ways with morphologically-assigned accent, using a corpus of 2,000 elicited verb forms (Vuillermet 2012). We show that the surface position of accent depends on syllable count, root transitivity, and the type of inflectional affix present, classifying affixes into dominant, recessive, and rightmost-preserving sub-types. Further, we argue that tense/mood suffixes are associated with different cophonologies (Inkelas & Zoll 2007) depending on which stem syllable they assign accent to and whether they enforce iterative iambs or trochees. Finally, in Ese'eja when accent is assigned outside the window, the position of primary prominence falls on a position which is rhythmically dependent on the window-external accent, e.g. uniformly two syllables away, termed 'Rhythmic Repair'. We contrast this novel type to 'Default Repair', where primary prominence is realized on a default position when accent appears outside of the metrical window (Kager 2012).",0
"This squib (based on a ms. written in March 2015) argues that null indefinite clitics in Greek do not exist: when a clitic is present, it may only be definite and overt, otherwise it is not there. Two arguments are put forward to support this idea. The implications about the nature of clitics in Greek as phase heads (and how this restricts movement properties of cliticized phrases in clitic dependencies) are also briefly discussed.",0
"This paper looks at a vowel zero alternation in Czech verbal prefixes (in comparison to Russian). We show that the data can only be explained if the prefix and the root form a constituent to the exclusion of all other verbal morphology, including the so-called theme marker: [[pref root] theme]. However, there are other phonological processes in Czech (infinitival lengthening), which suggest that the root and the theme marker form a constituent to the exclusion of the prefix: [pref [root theme]]. We argue that the apparent contradiction is resolved by prefix movement (Svenonius 2004). The prefix and the root are merged together, and there is a cycle of phonological computation that determines the vowel/zero status of the alternation site in the prefix. After the first cycle, the theme marker is added and the prefix moves higher up in the structure. This creates a remnant constituent containing just the root and the theme marker, and it is this remnant constituent that is subject to the infinitival lengthening.",0
"This paper describes a Haskell program that uses categorial grammar to interpret the semantics of complex tense and aspect constructions in English. For example, it can represent ""john will have been laughing"" as an expression of predicate logic. We believe that the formalism used by the program is interesting because of its compositional elegance: the intuitive semantics of constructions like the future perfect and pluperfect arise naturally from a few general morphological rules.

"Drawing on a two-million-word corpus of Sanskrit, two previously unrecognized generalizations are documented and analyzed concerning the morpho-prosodic conditioning of retroflex spreading (nati). Both reveal harmony to be attenuated across the left boundaries of roots (i.e. between a prefix and root or between members of a com- pound), in the sense that while harmony applies across these boundaries, when it does so, it accesses a proper subset of the targets otherwise accessible. This attenuation is analyzed here through the ""ganging up"" of phonotactics and output-output correspondence in serial HG. The article also simplifies the core analysis of the spreading rule, primarily through recognizing FlapOut, an articulatorily grounded constraint.",0
"In this dissertation, it is proposed that gender is a syntactic feature in the nominal head, which is expressed after the nominal is selected by the Num(eral)P(hrase). Every nominal has to have syntactic gender and without this feature there cannot be a nominal category. By this gender feature the nominal is an individuating category. In Spanish [gender] has to be specified as [+fem] or [-fem]. In human nominals, gender is specified in Syntax, and then [+fem] and [-fem] receive a sex construal (""female"" or ""male""). The remainder nominals are assignated [±fem] in Morphology, through an exhaustivity condition. However, sometimes a non-human nominal can also receive a gender specification in the Syntax, although under a different feature architecture from that of the human nominals. In this case, the gender specification implies a more individuated interpretation related to the mass/count distinction",0
"I argue that 'wh-agreement', in which dedicated agreement morphology cross-references an A'-extracted argument, and 'anti-agreement', in which an A'-extracted argument cannot control full agreement, are two instantiations of the same abstract phenomenon. Both effects are are the result of a φ-probe copying both φ- and wh-features from a goal. Patterns of anti-agreement and wh-agreement arise when partial or total impoverishment applies to the [φ+wh] feature bundle in the morphological component, blocking insertion of an otherwise appropriate, more highly specified agreement exponent.",0
"Cinque (1993) states that the most deeply embedded node within a syntactic structure carries main stress. Kratzer and Selkirk (2007) claims that main stress falls on the least embedded phrase within a spell-out domain. The current study investigates the predicative strength of the two approaches. The analysis shows that the computation proposed by Cinque (1993) is more successful in generating correct stress patterns for English nominal structures than the computation proposed by Krazter and Selkeirk (2007). The current study, therefore, concurs with Ahn (2015) who argues that English phrasal stress does not fall on the highest constituent/phrase within a spell-out domain, but the most deeply embedded one.",0
"I have proposed analyses of English 'went' and of English '*goed' that revolve around the notion of verbal theme vowel. These analyses do not invoke late  insertion. It may be that late insertion is systematically unavailable. That may be due to the fact that merge-based bottom-to-top derivations start with the phonology, merging phonological features and then segments, before moving up to syntactic features; if so, phonology feeds syntax and should not be factored out of it.",1
"This paper surveys the distribution of formal and semantic agreement in German, using three types of trigger nouns (gender mismatch nouns, pluralia tantum nouns, and polite pronouns) in four syntactic contexts (attributive, predicate/T, pronouns, and nominal ellipsis). The distribution of agreement is shown to be dependent on the properties of the controller and the target, as well as the type of agreement dependency. The paper provides new evidence for the existence of two types of nominal ellipsis, and establishes a context in which predicative agreement can be tested in German. The findings lead to a refined Agreement Hierarchy, and a dual feature system is proposed which derives the basic tendencies of the Agreement Hierarchy and leaves room for language-specific deviations.",0
"In the study of language learning, researchers sometimes ask how languages in contact are related. They compare the linguistic features of the languages, how the mental grammars of each language sub-system are represented, put to use in performance, and how they interact. Within a linguistic family, languages can be closely related or distantly related, an interesting factor, for example, in understanding bilingualism and second language development. Dialects, on the other hand, are considered to be variants of the same language. While there is no way to always draw a sharp line between the categories of language and dialect, it is necessary to distinguish between the two kinds of language variation by the application of uniform criteria. The distinction between dialect and language is important for designing bilingual instructional programs, both for students who already speak two languages and for beginning second language learners.",0
"En la presente evaluación de la investigación sobre el contacto del español con las lenguas autóctonas de América proponemos una mayor integración entre las disciplinas que han enfocado el tema. En particular, falta incorporar plenamente los avances en los estudios sobre la adquisición y aprendizaje de segundas lenguas y el desarrollo bilingüe. El español en América ofrece la oportunidad ideal para lograr esta conciliación por contar con el campo más importante de su adquisición como primera lengua y su aprendizaje como segunda, en contacto desde el siglo XVI con cientos de otros idiomas. Abordaremos dos casos divergentes de intercambio entre lengua nacional y lengua indígena. De hipótesis, en el primero el intercambio ha resultado en el mantenimiento de la autonomía de las dos lenguas, a pesar de una amplia gama de influencias mutuas; en el segundo los investigadores debaten la posibilidad de una convergencia.

In particular, it is still necessary to fully incorporate the advances from the fields of second language acquisition and learning and of bilingual development. Spanish in America offers the ideal opportunity to achieve this consilience because the New World represents the most important realm of its acquisition as first language and its learning as second language, in contact since the 16th Century with hundreds of other languages. We will take up two contrasting cases of indigenous language-national language interaction. By hypothesis, in the first instance the interchange has resulted in the maintenance of mutual autonomy, despite widespread mutual influence; in the second, researchers are debating the posibility of a convergence.",0
"The purpose of this paper is to investigate an account of ergative-nominative alternations in non- perfective clauses in Nepali. As observed in many Indo-Aryan languages, the ergative case marker is obligatory in perfective tenses. The variable presence of ergative marking in the non-perfective domain of Nepali has been articulated as an expression of emphasis, subject animacy, or individual- level predication. I argue that that =le marks the subject of a categorical proposition in the sense of Kuroda (1972). I explore the felicity of =le in particular discourse contexts depending upon whether the response is presented thetically or categorically. I also note that =le may only be found in quantifier phrases with strong construal, which provides support for the notion that =le marks categorical subjects.",0

An account is thus offered within a minimal version of Type-Logical syntax, coupled with a simple semantic analysis.",1
"This work addresses some descriptive and theoretical aspects of the morphology of nouns in Italian, specifically of evaluative suffixes. The empirical issues being considered include the compatibility or mutual exclusion of evaluatives with one another and with other morphological constituents (gender suffixes, nominalizing suffixes, superlatives) as well as their relative order. The interaction of evaluatives with phrasal syntax is also considered, including the possibility of evaluative-suffixed adjectives to appear in post-nominal position only. We find evidence for concluding that evaluatives as well as other derivational suffixes can be equated to classifiers (for size, gender, etc.). This in turn raises questions as to the traditional distinction between derivational and inflectional morphemes, since the same classification system can be externalized by nominal class inflections.",0

"We address a long-standing puzzle in gradable adjectives, which is that positive adjectives may be prefixed with 'un-', but negative ones cannot, although negation of positive and negative adjectives alike is possible with 'not'. We present a nanosyntactic account of this restriction that assumes the presence of a [Neg] feature in negative adjectives. We further show that restrictions on stacking multiple negative markers are sensitive to the scope of these markers, such that they cannot be stacked if they take scope in the same position, but can be stacked if they are separated by intervening levels of structure. We account for this by formulating a restriction against the occurrence of two immediately consecutive [Neg] features in the functional sequence.",1
"The paper investigates head final effects (HF-effects) in German and English and argues that the syntactic configuration that underlies them gives rise to three different types of  violations in the interfaces. It is shown that HF-effects are either morphological or prosodic in nature. A diagnostics - morphological versus syntactic displacement -  is established that allows to connect HF-effects to their relevant interface conditions. The prosodic conditions on word order are then argued to be twofold: they involve a condition on heavy constituents, on the one hand, and a condition on the mapping of syntactic constituents onto prosodic constituents respecting the Strict Layer Hypothesis, on the other hand. Finally, I argue that a pure syntactic condition, like the Final-over-Final Constraint proposed by Biberauer, Holmberg and Roberts (2007, 2014, to appear) is inedaquate to account for the variable nature of HF-effects.",0
"Estonian negated indicative clauses show no agreement, whereas Estonian negated imperative clauses show agreement twice: once on the main verb and once on the negation word 'ära'. This contrasts with affirmative clauses, where agreement appears only once. I propose a unified syntax for agreement across these clausal types, arguing that the there is one head which bears a phi-feature probe in all Estonian sentences. There is no agreement in negated indicatives because this head has only one suitable vocabulary item in this context: 'ei'. Doubled agreement arises due to a rule of post- syntactic Feature Copying in imperative contexts. I argue that this analysis is superior to an analysis making use of multiple phi-feature probes in the syntax, as such analyses struggle to account for the optionality of doubling in first-person plural contexts. The proposed analysis makes predictions about the kinds of marking possible in negated imperatives, which appear to be borne out in related Uralic languages. This investigation supports a view of the morphosyntax of agreement whereby the syntax and morphology of agreement overlap but do not coincide.",1

"Child-directed speech might have an accelerating or decelerating effect on language development. Cross-linguistic research has recently implied the need to reconsider 'the more interaction, the more acquisition' model. We are also reminded that structural-linguistic measures, such as vocabulary size and mean length of utterance are only one aspect of a child's communicative competence, but some other skills related to pragmatics and conversation are required for language competence. The present study investigates the development of conversational and socio-pragmatic strategies in child discourse from a functional perspective. We especially focus on the impact of the parental input, and question the role of child's mother in the development of a child's conversational skills with particular regard to the question-answer forming, positive and negative reinforcement, the effects of frequency, and length of conversation. Our research aims to establish the relationship between the challenging communicative environment (lengthy conversations, parent-initiated speech, answers-at-hand, avoidance of motherese, etc.) and the development of a child's communicative competence. Our participants have been selected from 5 families. The group comprises totally 5 mothers and 5 Turkish-speaking children. We classified the families as conservative, conservative-pragmatic or modern-educated, and the children as younger and older. The data has been collected via open-ended interviews, and has been transcribed and tagged for analysis. We have found various patterns in parental input shaping a child's discourse, and the results revealed a significant difference between the two target groups' conversational strategies, which is due to the critical age for discourse strategies. While the mother's attempt to adapt her discourse resulted in self-confidence and freedom to question in children, as well as encouragement in initiating conversation to the older children, discouragement from asking questions and from discussing with older individuals had the reverse effect on the older children.",0
"In this paper, we re-examine the case for a split theory of concord (Baier 2015) which distinguishes between concord by Agree and Morphological Feature Copying as well as a split theory of affixation which distinguishes between head-to-head Lowering and Local Dislocation under linear adjacency. We have shown that both complications are redundant once we adopt our structural typology of adjectives. The empirical differences which gave rise to those split theories can in fact be accounted for by systematic variation in the structure of adjectives.",0
"An appealing property of the phase theory is that it is relevant to many phenomena, i.e. many domain-based mechanisms are stated in terms of phases. However, although phasal complements have no theoretical status in the phase theory (only phases do), they are taken to define spell-out units. This paper argues for an approach where phases define spell-out domains, which means that what is sent to spell-out is the phase itself. Several arguments to this effect are presented regarding syntax-phonology interaction (in particular, encliticization in Bulgarian and Arabic, stress assignment in German and English, raddoppiamento fonosintattico in Abruzzese, and tone sandhi in Taiwanese), as well as more theoretical issues such as labeling. The assumption, however, has significant consequences for successive-cyclic movement. If phases are sent to spell-out and what is sent to spell-out is inaccessible to the syntax, successive-cyclic movement cannot target phases. Under the account argued for here, successive-cyclic movement therefore does not proceed via phases (i.e. phasal edges). As a result, the account also eliminates the PIC.",0
"Urdu and Punjabi case markers are important to create a syntactic configuration, and they play a vital role in portraying their semantics. In different contexts, they expose different semantics. Urdu ko is equivalent to Punjabi nuː̃ and they mostly perform the same function in both languages. Data are taken from Punjabi and Urdu speakers. Punjabi nuː̃, like Urdu ko, reveals a contrasting semantics in active and passive sentences, because it can be used as dative and accusative. Dative nuː̃ and accusative nuː̃ being different case markers show distinctive functions, they sometimes show semantic ambiguity in the active and passive construction in the same sentence. This paper nullifies Islam, Akhtar & Bukhari's (2009) claim that ""… the inanimate object … takes accusative case marker [ko] only
because of demonstrative is 'this' which precedes it"", by bringing evidence against them. However, it approves their findings for the ambiguous role of Urdu ko in active and passive sentences by bringing the same results for Punjabi nuː̃.",0
"1. The problem: Words are a pervasive unit of syntax and yet the dominant theory of them, the X^0 theory, is problematic, predicting more parallels between phrasal and head movement than are observed. Phrasal movement approaches to word formation fare even worse on that score. Mirror Theory (MT) also has shortcomings, for example in relying on an unmotivated notion of specifier.

2. The solution: A theory of how syntactic structures are mapped onto functional and lexical words, positing syntactic features w for lexical access points and @ for linearization points. The theory draws on the late insertion of DM, the cycles of phase theory, the direct linearization principles of MT, and the non-terminal spell-out of Nanosyntax, separating word formation from linearization and appealing to spans (head-complement sequences) as the units of cyclic lexical access and storage.",0
"Bobaljik (2012) observes on the basis of an impressive sample of languages that root suppletion is hardly ever conditioned by degree markers that do not form a word with the root. He calls this the Root Suppletion Generalization (RSG). If true, the generalization provides a possible argument for the lexicalist position: RSG can be seen as a consequence of the lexicalist architecture, where words are built pre-syntax, and therefore syntax cannot influence their shape (Williams 2007). Against this background, this paper discusses evidence (some of it presented already in Bobaljik's work) that the RSG (when stated over words) is empirically (sometimes) too weak and (sometimes also) too strong. In view of these observations, I suggest an account that does not lend any support to lexicalism, simply because the word is not the relevant notion for blocking suppletion.",0
"This paper investigates the notion of normality in the context of the divide between word-formation and syntax. Knowledge about what is normal finds its expression in generic characterizations about kinds ('Ducks lay eggs'), and we will present evidence from German that newly formed word-formation products like 'Rotdach' ('red_roof'), in contrast to their phrasal counterparts, are more inclined to adopt kind readings. The compounds' affinity to function as names for kinds will be explained on grounds of a pragmatic, manner-based principle. It holds that deviation from the default way of forming a complex expression, i.e., from the phrasal expression, implicates a deviation from the compositional meaning of the complex. Viewed from this grammatical angle, the present paper argues for normality to be implemented in the language system in light of the understanding that morphology produces more marked forms than syntax.",0

"At first glance, Nez Perce looks like a language lacking any correlate of the traditional mass-count distinction.

I show that Nez Perce nevertheless makes two countability distinctions in noun semantics. A sums-based (cumulativity) distinction is revealed in the interaction of quantifiers with plural; a parts-based (divisiveness) distinction is revealed in certain quantity judgments. Both types of evidence involve complex structures to which language learners likely have little to no actual exposure. I suggest that Nez Perce furnishes a poverty of the stimulus argument in favor of semantic countability distinctions as a language universal.",0
"The goal of this paper is to analyze the nature of the dependency between an anaphor and its antecedent when the two are arguments of the same predicate (i.e. are co- arguments) - using the Dravidian language, Tamil, as a case-study. I will henceforth reserve the term ""reflexivity"" for this type of relation. Like cases of reflexivity in many languages (see Reinhart and Reuland, 1993; Jayaseelan, 1997; Reuland, 2001b, 2011, for an overview), this dependency is distinguished from other cases of anaphora in the language by being specially marked. This in turn suggests that reflexivity is special and requires recourse to additional grammatical devices than do standard cases of anaphora where the antecedent and anaphor are not co-arguments. Of particular importance here will be the structural interaction between grammatical perspective, represented along the mental and/or spatio-temporal dimensions in a syntactic perspectival phrase or PerspP (Sundaresan, 2012) and reflexivity.",0
"This article argues that Differential Argument Indexing (DOI) and Differential Argument
Marking (DOM) constructions in Coptic (Afroasiatic, Egypt) are reanalyzed, resulting in
a set of verbs with interposed P-indexes within bipartite stems (DeLancey 1996; Nichols
2003). Basically, incorporated noun phrases with prefixed possessor indexes become parts
of derived verbs with unpredictable lexical semantics, and their erstwhile possessor prefixes,
entrapped within the derived verb, are reanalyzed as P-interpositions. Since this possessor
prefix ultimately developed from an earlier possessor suffix, the pathway documented here,
stripped down to its essentials, is suffix → prefix → interposition, and erstwhile complex
construction → bipartite stem. Finally, an overt genitive prefix that marks lexical
possessors of incorporated noun phrases is reanalyzed as an accusative case prefix. These
changes introduce new complexity into Coptic Differential Argument Marking: not only
are P arguments either indexed as suffixes, case marked, or incorporated for the majority of
verbs, they can be indexed as interpositions for a lexically determined set of verbs.",0
"This paper investigates the properties of plural agreement that is triggered by collective nouns in British English. Both singular and plural agreement are able to appear with these collective nouns, which are shown to be morphologically singular but semantically plural. Plural agreement however is systematically more restricted than singular agreement, appearing in a subset of the environments where singular agreement is allowed. Restrictions on plural come from the nature of agreement; semantic agreement features can only enter into agreement when the controller of agreement c-commands the target of agreement, whereas morphologically motivated agreement is not subject to the same structural restriction. This asymmetry between the two types of agreement is shown to arise from the proposal that AGREE (Chomsky 2000, 2001) is distributed over the syntactic and post-syntactic component (Arregi & Nevins 2012).",0
"This paper provides evidence for a kind of nominal licensing (Vergnaud licensing) in a number of morphologically caseless languages. Recent work on Bantu languages, has suggested that abstract Case or nominal licensing should be parameterised (Diercks 2012, Van der Wal 2015a). With this is mind, we critically discuss the status of Vergnaud licensing in six languages lacking morphological case and agreement. While Luganda appears to systematically lack a Vergnaud licensing requirement, Makhuwa more consistently displays evidence in favour of it, as do all of the analytic languages that we survey (Mandarin, Yoruba, Jamaican Creole and Thai). We conclude that, while it seems increasingly problematic to characterise nominal licensing in terms of uninterpretable/abstract Case features, we nonetheless need to retain a (possibly universal) notion of nominal licensing, the explanation for which remains opaque.",0
"The study of the biological foundations of language is sometimes called biolinguistics. This particular term finds its historical origins in the 1950s, and for various reasons it has also gained considerable traction in recent years. While its increasing use apparently signals an equally increasing interest in biology, apart from a few exceptions not much is added to and beyond standard linguistic theorizing by those linguists who use it, resulting in a complex and confusing literature. This state of affairs has led, on the one hand, to the perpetuation of proposals that are hard to relate to the biological literature and, on the other, to ill-placed criticism on the progress and even the very legitimacy of a biologically-informed study of language. By reviewing different ways in which research under the biolinguistics label has been carried out, as well as some common criticisms, we hope to dispel some misconceptions about what constitutes a biolinguistic approach, as well as point out what we contend is real progress in the study of the biological bases and evolution of the human language faculty, to which the term is better and rightly applied.",0
"In this paper I provide a description and analysis of a small class of plural mass nouns in Telugu (Dravidian), as well as an overview of the major properties of the mass/count distinction in the language. The plural mass nouns show the semantic behaviour of mass nouns in Telugu, however, they show the morphosyntactic behaviour of count nouns. I provide an analysis whereby the plurality is inherent to the roots, and it is this inherent plurality interacting with other properties of the morphosyntax of Telugu that makes these nouns appear to be count on the surface, though in reality they are mass nouns.",0
The review contains a short summary of the book and a longer evaluation of its content with some focus on problematic issues in the analysis.,0
"Nominalizing reduplication in American Sign Language (ASL) is an ambiguous process that can derive both concrete object- and result-denoting nominals. The properties of this nominalization process, including this ambiguity, are accounted for here by appealing to the discrete and surface transparent morphology the language uses to encode components of event (Wilbur 2003, 2010) and argument (Benedicto and Brentari 2004) structure. Nominalizing reduplication is shown to be a process that nominalizes (and reduplicates) only the low portion of verbal structure responsible for encoding the event result (VP-Res). Direct nominalization of this VP-Res constituent yields nominals with result-denoting interpretations. Concrete object-denoting interpretations may arise when the verbal structure contains an argument classifier, evident in the handshape of the verbal predicate. In such cases, the nominal argument introduced by the classifier serves as the input to reduced relative clause formation, yielding a concrete object-denoting interpretation. The interpretive ambiguity is thus reduced to ambiguity in the syntactic structure underlying the derived nominal. This approach falls in line with longstanding structural approaches to nominalization and more recent proposals regarding processes of reduplication (Inkelas and Zoll 2005).",0
"The aim of this paper is to look comparatively at verbs denoting change of colour or causation of change of color in English and Romanian, pointing out the differences between languages and providing a syntactic representation able to capture their formation.
English makes use of three types of verbs/ verbal constructions to denote processes related to colour: (i) verbs whose form is identical to that of the adjective/ noun they are derived from (such as to blue, to gray, to yellow, to brown, to green), (ii) verbs created with the suffix –en (such as to whiten, to blacken, to redden), (iii) verbal paraphrases (such as to turn pink/ orange). In contrast, in Romanian, one can note the use of (i) verbal paraphrases such as a face ca ceva să fie roz/ gri/ maro/ portocaliu 'to make that something should be pink/ gray/ brown/ orange', and (ii) verbs created with the prefix în- (a înălbi 'to prefix-white-verbal suffix'- to whiten, a înnegri 'to prefix-black-verbal suffix'- to blacken, a înroşi 'to prefix-red-verbal suffix'- to redden, a îngălbeni 'to prefix-yellow-verbal suffix', a înverzi 'to prefix-green-verbal suffix'). Most English colour verbs have the same form as the noun/ adjective they derive from (which is in line with the general observation that English tends to use identical denominal/ deajectival verbs (Hale & Keyser 2002)). Possibly in accordance with Berlin & Kay's (1973) remark that there is a hierarchy of colours and colour words, the suffix –en in English is used with fundamental colours (red, white, black), while, for the other colours, no suffix is used. In contrast, Romanian uses the prefix în- in almost all cases (but there are exceptions e.g. a roşi 'to blush'), while using paraphrases with more recent words denoting colours (roz 'pink', maro 'brown', portocaliu 'orange').
From an aspectual point of view, verbs denoting colour processes are degree achievements (expressing a gradual change of state) (Hay, Kennedy &Levin 1999). They display both telic and atelic properties, combining both with for-phrases and in-phrases (I reddened the wall in 5 minutes, I reddened the wall for an hour). Moreover, they can essentially appear in two structures (an intransitive one: The wall yellowed, and a transitive one: I yellowed the wall). In Romanian, the first structure is expressed with the help of a reflexive clitic (Peretele s-a îngălbenit 'The wall clitic reflexive-has prefix-yellowed'), while the transitive form is similar to the one in English (Am îngălbenit peretele 'Have yellowed the wall').
Combining Ramchand's analysis (2008, 2014) with Brody's (2000) idea that the intermediary level should be eliminated, I embrace the view that words spell out a span, i.e. a complement sequence of heads (@ indicates where the span spells out, and * the formation of a word with the head immediately below). I discuss a causative and locative meaning of -en and în- for English and Romanian (to redden= to cause to pass in a state of red).",0
"This paper addresses typological differences in subject–verb agreement, and provides evidence
that transitive subject agreement need not always involve a high functional head, i.e. T0, but may
instead be the result of a local relation between the subject and a low functional head, v0. In
Mayan languages, grammatical relations are head-marked on the predicate through two series of
morphemes, known as ""Set A"" (ergative/possessive) and ""Set B"" (absolutive). I argue that Set
A morphemes reflect a local relationship of agreement between transitive v0 and the subject in
its specifier position and, in an analogous structural configuration, between possessive n0 and the
possessor. Crucially, I show that no higher functional projection is involved. This is important
in light of proposals that ergative agreement systems are epiphenomenal, resulting from standard
nominative agreement from T0 which is blocked from agreeing with morphologically case-marked
ergative subjects (Woolford 2010). In this paper I examine the morphologically ergative Mayan
language Chol to show true ergative agreement is possible even in the absence of morphological
case. This paper has implications for the typology of ergative case and agreement systems, and
contributes to our understanding of the nature of agreement and clitic doubling.",0
"In Czech as well as other Slavic languages, verbal particles (throw the cat OUT) are always glued to the verb, and can never be separated from it. Therefore, they are traditionaly analyzed as forming a complex head with the verb. Against this background, we look at an alternation in vocalic length that can be found with a couple of prefixes in Czech. We argue that the best way to understand this alternation is in terms of their free/bound status. Hence, we propose that despite the fact that the prefixes are always glued to the verb, they actually undergo the same process as Germanic particles. The reason why they are always glued to the verb is because of the way pied-piping works; when the verb moves, it moves as a big phrase and always carries the particle along.",0
"In this paper we show, following work by Nevins (2011), that there is a fundamental distinction between default person and default number. Third person has a feature specification, while singular number does not. The argument is based on configurations in which two φ-feature bundles compete for spell-out. In the case of number, this never results in a clash. Instead, there will be omnivorous number: the verb shows plural agreement whenever at least one of the feature bundles is specified as plural. By contrast, in the case of person this situation can lead to a clash. This accounts for the impossibility of having a lower nominative with a different person specification than the subject in both Icelandic quirky subject constructions and Dutch clefts. Those cases where a verb does show omnivorous person agreement are the result of language-specific person hierarchies used for resolution. We present an account of such hierarchies that is in line with the assumption that third person is not feature-less.",0
"In the prethematic high~mid alternation of Spanish third-conjugation verbs,  allomorph selection by phonological subcategorization in the morphology interacts with allomorph selection by phonotactic optimization in the phonology, pace Paster (2015). The cyclic locality conditions on this alternation support frameworks with stem storage (Bermúdez-Otero 2013a) or spanning (Svenonius and Haugen & Siddiqi in this volume), and challenge single-terminal insertion. Embick's (2012) alternative analysis weakens inward cyclic locality excessively. Myler's (2015) counterproposal overgenerates and undermines the explanation of the parallel cyclic transmission of allomorphy and allosemy. Allomorphy-allosemy mismatches do occur: e.g. when English _trànsp[ə]rtátion_ preserves the argument structure of _trànspórt_ but not its bipedality. However, such mismatches are not generated computationally; they arise diachronically through the interplay of computation and storage (Bermúdez-Otero 2012). Theories asserting that words lack constituent structure cannot explain this fact, pace Blevins, Ackerman & Malouf (this volume).",0
"This paper argues in favor of the hypothesis that there are two definite articles in natural language, a weak article which expresses uniqueness and a strong article which expresses anaphoricity. The study is based on the distribution of definite articles in Icelandic and they are found to alternate along the same empirical dimension as weak and strong articles in German. Furthermore, the Icelandic pattern manifests a structural interaction which is similar to English do-support and we refer to it as the-support. We argue that the similarities between do-support and the-support suggest that studies of the two phenomena can benefit from considering them to be related at a deep abstract level. Thus, consequences ensue for the theory of suffixation under adjecency.",0
"The topic of my paper is the syntax and the quantificational force of free-choice items (FCIs) in Hungarian. FCIs such as any have been at the forefront of research interest in the past decades (e.g., Ladusaw 1979; Kadmon & Landman 1993; Giannakidou 2001). The close interdependence of syntactic, semantic and even pragmatic considerations makes the study of FCIs one of the most interesting research programmes. Earlier investigations of the syntax and semantics of FCIs in Hungarian include Hunyadi (1991; 2002), Abrusán (2007) and Szabó (2012). In my paper, I show that FCIs in Hungarian occupy the syntactic position associated with distributive quantifiers (É. Kiss 2010). Furthermore, I examine the quantificational force of FCIs by the well-known battery of quantification tests (for a previous application for Hungarian, cf. Surányi 2006): almost-modification, modification by exceptive phrase, donkey anaphora, predicative use, is-modification, incorporation and split reading with modals. My findings of
mixed quantificational behaviour provide further corroboration for the analysis of FCIs as quantificationally underspecified intensional dependent indefinites.",0
"Fratini et al. (2014) concluded that frequency and morphological irregularity are in Spanish, unlike in English, independent variables. In this paper I take issue with that claim. On the one hand, it is argued that the borders between regularity and irregularity are diffuse. Many of the verbs classified by Fratini et al. (2014) as irregular might, therefore, not be so. In addition, the choice of lexemes they analyzed was far from adequate. Their set of irregular verbs contained many verbs formed by adding some prefix to a more frequent irregular verb (e.g. a-venir, a-tener, con-decir, con-mover...) and many highly infrequent lexemes in general, barely in use in the speech community (e.g. abnegar, ablandecer, amoblar, amodorrecer...). In an alternative corpus analysis it has been found that, when these and other shortcomings in Fratini et al. (2014) are dealt with, morphological irregularity and frequency are indeed strongly correlated variables also in Spanish.",0
This chapter provides an overview of quantification strategies in American Sign Language.,0
"This study investigates the memorization of complex lexical items from a cross-linguistic perspective and in the context of the debate about the demarcation between morphology and syntax. For this purpose, we conducted an experimental study in which German, French and English adjective-noun oun-adjective combinations (e.g. Jungtourist, jeune touriste, YOUNG tourist, young TOURist) were tested with respect to how well they were memorized. Using existing nouns (e.g. Architekt, architecte, architect) as a baseline, we found evidence that the German AN constructions under investigation exhibit a memorization advantage in comparison to the French AN/NA constructions. We attribute the effect to the compound status of the German constructions as well as their morphological origin, in contrast to the syntactic source of the French constructions. For the English constructions, we considered stress (YOUNG tourist vs. young TOURist) to be a determining factor, which we hypothesized to interact with semantic compositionality. This interplay was examined in a second study, which revealed that non-compositional structures with initial stress (e.g. HARD shirt) gave rise to compound-like effects in comparison to the phrase-like compositional constructions with non-initial stress (e.g. short BRUSH). In conclusion, we argue for a cognitively grounded distinction between word-formation and syntax, where memorization has turned out to be a suitable test environment.",0
"In Distributed Morphology, the insertion of vocabulary entries can be conditioned by the surrounding context. There are two locality constraints that are generally thought to constrain this contextual allomorphy: a restriction on its domain and an adjacency requirement. Northern Paiute reveals something about both these locality conditions. Verb suppletion in the language requires the domain of contextual allomorphy to extend beyond both a maximal projection (Bobaljik 2012) and syntactic sisterhood (Bobaljik and Harley 2013). But the outer limits of this domain remain out of sight, at least in Northern Paiute. Verb suppletion exhibits an intervention effect: the trigger must be the closest possible trigger. In the spirit of Arregi and Nevins (2012), I propose this arises from an adjacency requirement that is relativized to syntactic category. This successfully accounts for verb suppletion in Northern Paiute, and it may help with several recalcitrant cases of non-local contextual allomorphy.",0
"This dissertation is about the basic building blocks that make up words, and how these building blocks interact with the rest of the grammar. The grammar is generally viewed as an inventory of contentful units and the rules governing their combination. One question for linguistic theory is what these units might be like. Are they different for different languages? A second question is how these pieces are put together, and again we ask whether these combinatory processes are the same in different languages. A third question is to ask what we can build. This study concentrates on building verbs, specifically how the grammar builds their structure in a way that then constrains semantic interpretation and phonological pronunciation.

The empirical domain is the verbal system of Modern Hebrew, where this work attempts to unify our treatment of concatenative and non-concatenative morphology. The hypothesis put forward is that hierarchical syntactic structure, once generated, must be interpreted according to specific locality constraints when transferred to the interfaces with semantics and phonology. At each interface additional calculations take place. These calculations are interface-particular: semantics and phonology are not identical objects of study. Yet the two have in common a locality constraint on calculations that derives directly from the syntactic structure. In addition, individual lexical items (""roots"") place their own requirements on the meaning and/or the pronunciation. The theory developed here limits this influence of roots to the two interfaces, making the claim that individual roots have no syntactic features. Nevertheless, roots are active at the interfaces in ways that are predictable once the right generalizations are sought out. The phonological form of roots is relevant at the phonology and their lexical semantics is relevant at the semantics: roots have no syntactic features, only interface requirements.

Hebrew, being a contemporary Central Semitic language, shows the kind of non-concatenative, ""root-and-pattern"" morphology that is organized around consonantal ""roots"" and prosodic ""templates"", the latter consisting of a prosodic shape, certain vowels and an affix. The account put forward argues that Hebrew roots are abstract lexical elements which combine with discrete syntactic functional heads. The combination, once fed through the phonology of the language, results in morphophonological templates which are not primitives of the system in and of themselves. The architecture defended supports the view of constrained interpretation at the interfaces which lies at the core of this proposal, using non-hierarchical surface forms in order to mount an argument for hierarchical structure.

Chapter one of the dissertation introduces the issues at hand and the basics of the Hebrew verbal system. It also reviews a number of earlier approaches which help set the stage for the analysis that follows.

Chapter two develops the syntactic-semantic part of the proposal, defining the syntactic elements needed to derive verbal morphology both for Hebrew and crosslinguistically. It is shown that the different combinations of these elements produce the verbal system of Hebrew in a way that is constrained, in the semantics, by the lexical idiosyncrasies of individual roots.

Chapter three takes the proposed structures and manipulates them in the phonological component of the grammar. The view of linearization pursued here is shown to make correct predictions. The effect of different classes of roots is highlighted, and the point is made that verbal templates are not holistic morphemes but the spell-out of distinct functional heads.

Chapter four takes a quantitative approach, surveying previous psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic work on Semitic languages and presenting novel findings from a recent magnetoencephalography experiment. These findings support the claims made in the previous chapters regarding the organization of the system.

Chapter five considers how the child might acquire this system. Recent developmental findings are surveyed and a novel computational model is discussed. This chapter outlines a model of Semitic acquisition in which the consonantal character of roots is used as a learning cue, leading to acquisition of basic verbal templates and eventually the system as a whole.

Chapter six concludes, recapitulating the main contributions of this work: derivations in a generative grammar combine rigid grammatical principles with unstructured lexical material. This dissertation defends an explicit view of how such combination takes place.",0
"Quotation is a device that is used to refer to the particular linguistic shape of an expression. An instance are name-mentioning constructions involving 'sogenannt' in German as in 'sogenannte Sepsis' ('so-called sepsis'). The present paper examines the varying interpretations a 'sogenannt'-construction can adopt. In contrast to 'Sepsis', a noun like 'Hotel', for example, as in 'sogenanntes Hotel' ('so-called hotel') gives rise to a 'distanced' interpretation of the construction rather than one informing about a concept's name. A unitary semantic analysis will be proposed for 'sogenannt', where the individual readings emerge from an interplay between lexical factors like the head nominal's establishedness, on the one hand, and pragmatic implicatures rooted in relevance- as well as manner-based principles, on the other. From a compositional perspective, the 'so' in 'sogenannt' will be reasoned to be identical in function to quotation marks as a means to refer to a linguistic shape through demonstration. The different interpretations of the construction will be coupled with the type of binding of the agent-argument variable as well as the event variable of the verbal root 'nenn-' ('call') of 'sogenannt'.",1
"In this paper it is proposed that a basic difference in structural dependency, the difference between selected complements of a head on the one hand and unselected adjuncts to a projection of a head on the other, correlates with a basic interpretive difference which is central to understanding the range of complex predicate constructions. Adjuncts, such as depictive predicates, are interpreted as conjuncts, as is commonly assumed. The standard assumption about complements is that their interpretation is by function application, where the specifics are then determined by the semantics of the selecting head. Here it is proposed that there is a common interpretive core to complementation, one which is monotonic and in some abstract sense mereological. This applies both to extended projections and to complements which are embedded in another extended projection, and is exemplified by resultatives as well as other secondary predicate types. The interpretation is monotonic in the sense that the selecting head preserves the interpretation of the complement, elaborating on it. It is mereological in the related sense that the complement is interpreted as an integral part of the interpretation of the whole.",0
"I propose that much of the 'allomorphy' associated with the three noun classes of Afar can be derived phonologically. In fact, it is not (properly speaking) allomorphy at all - in the sense that there is no selection between different morphs. This forms part of a program that attempts to remove class features from generative grammar. Eradicating noun class features, as is done for this data, allows for a more elegant and minimalist analysis with a clear demarcation between the features of semantic interpretation (e.g. [+fem]) and the features of phonological form (e.g. [+high]). In this way it upholds the architecture of grammar made popular by distributed morphology. In this problematic case study, we see that Afar nominal paradigms are characterized by both the introduction of features/melody and paradigm-specific stress shifts. The proposed re-analysis relies heavily on the notion of catalexis. Using a Strict CV representational model, I propose that nouns in Afar are always trochaic. The tripartite difference in the shape of nominal roots is reduced to what part of the trochee's dependent CV is filled by melody: both C and V (V-Masc) [ˈbara] 'night', only C (C-Masc) [maˈtuk] 'butter' or neither (Fem) [ħaˈdo] 'meat'. The shape of these roots juxtaposed with the shape of the Afar affixes regularly predicts the 'allomorphy'. The underlying form of the proposed affixes have an unusual structural condition, though one that is predicted by foundational autosegmental principles. These come with both features and skeletal structure unassociated to each other. Consequently, following my proposal, affixation can simultaneously introduce features and induce stress shift in a DM-compatible item-and-arrangement analysis, all the while without recourse to class features.",0
"A'-movement in Gitksan (Tsimshianic) makes a three way morphological distinction between the extraction of transitive subjects, intransitive subjects, and objects (Rigsby, 1986; Hunt, 1993; Davis and Brown, 2011). I argue that despite the descriptive generalisation that Gitksan has a tripartite extraction paradigm, this pattern actually instantiates a general ban on the extraction of ergatives. I suggest that ergative extraction construction in Gitksan involves a nominalisation construction as a alternative to the (illicit) movement of a transitive subject. One piece of evidence for this claim is that the morpheme involved in agent extraction constructions (an) is also a nominaliser. I also present new evidence that a similar construction is utilised in Gitksan to 'fix' otherwise illicit long-distance extractions from clauses that attach as adjuncts. This provides a strong piece of counter-evidence to recent claims that head-marking languages cannot have extraction restrictions (Deal, 2016).",0
"A'-movement in Gitksan (Tsimshianic) morphologically and syntactically distinguishes between the extraction of intransitive subjects, transitive subjects, and objects. Despite the tripartite appearance of this system, I suggest that this pattern instantiates a ban on the extraction of ergatives. The main piece of evidence for this claim comes from a similar construction that surfaces in long- distance extraction from adjunct clauses. Both agent extraction and long-distance extraction from adjunct clauses are characterized by a pre-predicative morpheme an and a dependent clause remnant (contra intransitive subject and object extraction). I suggest that an, which is also a productive nominalizer in Gitksan is appearing in these constructions as a 'fix' for otherwise illicit extraction of ergatives, as well as from adjunct clauses. This can provide a piece of counter-evidence to a recent claim that head-marking languages cannot have extraction restrictions (Deal 2016).",0
"This paper brings into question recent proposals that all types of Hungarian verbal modifiers are merged in the complement zone of the verb, and argues that certain verbal particles and resultatives are merged as specifiers in the extended verb phrase. The empirical focus of the paper is inseparable particle verbs. Verbal particles and resultatives do not behave uniformly when it comes to combinability with inseparable particle verbs: some particles and resultatives can co-occur with inseparable particles verbs, while others cannot. We will argue that particles and resultatives that belong to the former group are merged in a specifier position, while those belonging to the latter group are merged in the verb's complement. Our results also support the view that objects are merged as specifiers rather than as complements (Bowers, 1993; Arad, 1996; Hale & Keyser, 1993; and Den Dikken, 2015b).",0
"The present contribution focusses on a set of phenomena which are unified by the
typological literature under the label of Suffixaufnahme. The theoretical focus of the contribution is the minimalist rule of Agree and the notion of case, specifically oblique case. We question the necessity of [interpretable] and [valued] features for the formulation of Agree. We suggest that more primitive syntactic notions underlie the descriptive label oblique, specifically that of an elementary relator with a part/whole content. Thus the DP embedded under a genitive case/adposition is interpreted as a possessor/whole with respect to a local superordinate DP (the possessum/part). We argue that case/agreement stacking corresponds to the presence of a partial copies of this second argument within the phrasal projection of the relator. In section 2 we apply this analysis to linkers, using Albanian as a case study; we then go on to case/agreement stacking in Punjabi (section 3) and in the Australian languages (e.g. Lardil), which are often taken as the core instantiation of the phenomenon.",1
"This dissertation defends a strong version of the view that linguistic surface complexity is the product of interactions between deep syntactic mechanisms and shallow interface-specific mechanisms. I argue that current developments in the theory of locality in Distributed Morphology (Embick 2010, Marantz 2013) impose boundaries on syntactic analysis and that morphemes cannot be identified and analyzed without studying their realization at the interfaces of syntax with both phonology and interpretation. The empirical focus is on a series of phenomena which are attested in Icelandic noun phrases and involve the realization of roots, category-defining heads, inflection morphemes, and definite articles, all of which may appear in the same noun as shown below. 

(1) leik-end-ur-nir 'play'-nmlz-m.nom.pl-def 

Three main components of the dissertation involve applicative structures, definite articles and morphophonology. I argue for the existence of applicatives in noun phrases which do not include a verbal substructure based on the realization of morphemes in an Icelandic Caused Experience construction. A study which compares definite articles in German and Icelandic supports the findings in Schwarz (2009) that there are two definite articles in natural language and the realization of the Icelandic articles has implications for the theory of suffixation under adjacency (Embick and Noyer 2001). These case studies, in addition to a series of smaller case studies, support the view that an analysis of one linguistic component may only be well-informed if it considers other interacting components as well. My method, to approach a well-defined empirical case, Icelandic nouns, with a precise theoretical framework like Distributed Morphology, yields valuable results. I show how many types of locality constraints interact in the same word and this is pleasing because it shows that the theory is not based on convenient but cross-linguistically isolated data sets. Rather, aspects of language like syntax, morphology and semantics are constantly interacting and they are best understood in the context of each other.",0
"In this paper, I bring the phenomenon of Korean nominative-nominative case-stacking to bear on the current debate over Agree (e.g. Chomsky 2000, 2001) versus Dependent Case (e.g. Marantz 1991, Baker 2015) models. I argue that nominative-nominative stacking is incompatible with an Agree model of case-assignment. However, an emended Dependent Case model is well-suited to capture nominative-nominative case-stacking.",0
"Recent research into the nature of periphrasis converges on the view that periphrastic forms occupy cells in morphological paradigms. This paper argues that the relative past ('perfect') in Dutch should be understood as periphrastic in this sense. Adopting the current minimalist view on the relation between morphology and syntax, in which inflectional morphemes are not generated in syntax but realized postsyntactically in a morphological component, the analysis leads to the conclusion that the relative past's auxiliary is not an element of narrow syntax either. The paper argues that this approach simplifies the syntactic analysis of Dutch verb clusters. The upshot of the analysis is that since auxiliaries undergo verb-second, verb movement must be a postsyntactic operation, as suggested by Chomsky (2001).",0
"In this paper I will provide a new argument for post-syntactic morphology.
The empirical evidence comes from so-called displaced morphology in Ger-
man where the non-ﬁnite verb form selected by a given governor does not end
up on the immediately dependent verb but rather on the last verb of the verb
cluster. The placement of the morphology thus depends on linear notions such
as adjacency rather than hierarchical relations (c-command, minimality). I
will argue that the exponents for non-ﬁnite morphology are inserted into sepa-
rate functional heads which are linearized clause-ﬁnally. At a late stage of the
PF-derivation, the exponents are associated with their verbal hosts by means
of Local Dislocation (Embick and Noyer 2001). As a consequence, the non-
ﬁnite morphology always comes last in the verb cluster. Displacement arises
once the order in the verb cluster deviates from the strictly descending 321 or-
der. The placement operation is thus always the same, displacement emerges
just a side-effect of (partially) ascending verb cluster orders.",0
"This paper explores the nature of the post-syntactic operations responsible for the
representations of linear order of terminal nodes. In particular, it argues in favor of a unified
model of the morphosyntax and morphophlonology, wherein the theory of Distributed
Morphology and Optimality theory operate in a single grammar. The testing ground is an
investigation of the formation of morphological causatives in Moroccan Arabic. Herein, the
process realizing causatives is morphological gemination, whereby the second consonant of
the root is doubled. Investigating the question of what triggers the infixal process, we argue
against the linearization algorithm suggested in Embick & Noyer (2001), Embick & Marantz
(2006), and Embick (2006, 2010). Instead, the claim we defend here is that the onus of the
linearization process falls on the prosody in Arabic, the central assumption being that the
morphosyntactic structure, the output of the syntactic derivation, is the input to OT
morphophonological constraints. These constraints are responsible for the linearization of the
terminal nodes of the syntactic derivation.",0
"This paper is concerned with the syntax and morphology of A'-extraction effects in the Niger-Congo language Wolof, and what they can tell us about well known properties of A'-movement - cyclicity and locality. Wolof exhibits three different A'-extraction effects: morphological marking of the cyclicity of movement, agreement in class between the wh-complementizer and the extracted phrase, and a subject on-subject asymmetry, akin to the that-trace effect. The analysis developed here aims to show that agreement lies at the center of all A′-extraction effects, and that their surface morpho-syntactic properties can at least partly be understood as resulting from the general mechanisms underlying the operation Agree, such as the presence of particular uninterpretable features and their location. Wolof is particularly suitable for the exploration of not only the morpho-synatax of A'-movement, but also the interaction of various A'-extraction effects. All the aforementioned effects in Wolof surface on C, and their interaction triggers allomorphy of the complementizer. The novelty of the approach advocated in this paper is in maintaining a unified syntax for different types of A′-movement structures, and providing a realizational analysis in the framework of Distributed Morphology, which attributes the surface differences in the CP layer in Wolof to post-syntactic conditions on feature co-occurrence, known to exist in many languages.",1
"In his recent book ""Patterns and Categories in English Suffixation and Stress Placement: A Theoretical and Quantitative Study,"" Zamma (2013) identified four classes of English suffixes in terms of the (i) root attachment behaviors and (ii) stress patterns, instead of the more traditional ""Class 1 vs. Class 2"" distinction (Siegel, 1974). He showed that these four types of suffixes are not evenly distributed in the English lexicon, and their distributions are affected by whether the suffixes are light or heavy. He went on to argue that with the theory of unranked constraints developed by Anttila (2002), we can predict these distributions. This short paper offers a statistical reassessment of this claim using a bootstrap resampling method.",0
"Published proposals that paired intransitive and transitive verb stems in Japanese (nao-r- 'get better', nao-s- 'make better') are syntactic constructions of root plus little v (Volpe 2005, Harley 2012, Marantz 2013) rest empirically on a database (Jacobsen 1992, Volpe 2005) that consists entirely of such transitivity pairs.  The procedure for root identification assumed by those proposals thus involves only pairwise examination of verbal stems, disregarding both stems of other lexical categories and verbal stems outside the transitivity pair.  Relaxation of these constraints, which have no principled basis, reveals that a significant minority of Japanese verb stems in fact display sequences of two transitivity-determining suffixes (yuru- 'slack (adj.)', yuru-m- 'slacken (intr.)', yuru-m-e- 'slacken (tr.)'; nezi 'screw', nezi-r- 'twist (tr.)', nezi-r-e- 'get twisted').  

The recognition of sequences of transitivity-determining suffixes allows us to test the hypothesis that those suffixes are syntactic elements by examining how they interact with each other.  When this is done, we find that, in sharp contrast to what is observed with uncontroversially syntactic elements like auxiliary verbs, an outer transitivity suffix must be taken to render an inner one inert for purposes of semantic interpretation and argument structure.  A parallel argument is provided by the interaction of the verbal suffix -m- and the adjectival suffix -si-:  voiding of the properties of the inner element is again observed, along with the added complication that the order in which those two suffixes occur is an idiosyncratic function of the individual root.  A final argument against taking the combination of root and transitivity suffix to be a syntactic construction is the diachronic instability of the putatively compositional interpretation thereof; I consider in particular the case of causative -s-.  In conclusion, I briefly consider the choices available for alternative modes of characterizing the knowledge that speakers have about the semantic and morphological relations among stems.",0
"We focus on the observation that the interpretation of some elliptical utterances does not match that made available by the putative non-elliptical alternant. We propose an account of this couched in the assumption that ellipsis involves non- insertion of (otherwise) pronounced material in the PF-branch (Merchant 2005, Saab 2008, amongst others). The capacity for ellipsis to give rise to implicatures, unavailable in the absence of ellipsis, follows from standard and independently motivated assumptions about the featural content of pronounced lexical items (as opposed to elided/unpronounced items, extending ideas in Kratzer 1998, 2009, Safir 2014). Our approach is consistent with a view of the identity condition on ellipsis resolution that crucially incorporates a semantic/interpretive component.",0
"Talmy's (2000) satellite-/verb-framed typology can be accounted for, in its diachronic instantiations, through a parameter. Taking as a starting point Biberauer & Roberts's (2012, 2015) classification of parameters, I point out that this variation shows the diachronic pattern attributed by these authors to mesoparameters, i.e., parameters affecting a core functional category, in this case the one encoding directionality, Path (Acedo-Matellán 2010, 2016). Specifically, the two possible values of Path are its phasal or non-phasal status (Real-Puigdollers 2013). In the former case, Path conforms a spell-out domain of its own, yielding the directional satellites typical of satellite-framed languages. In the latter case Path has to form a spell-out domain with the verb, giving rise to the path-encoding verbs typical of verb-framed languages. I explore the satellite- to verb-framed change in the history of Latin-Romance and Greek, and the reverse change in the development of certain Rhaeto-Romance varieties. Only in the latter case is there reason to believe that language contact has played a relevant role.",0
"This paper surveys the current debate on the morphome, drawing attention to underexplored theoretical possibilities and underexploited empirical tools. We distinguish three related but separate claims made by proponents of the morphome: that there exist morphological patterns mapping arbitrary sets of exponenda onto arbitrary sets of exponents; that such patterns do not suffer from a learnability disadvantage; and that all patterns of exponence are mediated by purely morphological categories belonging to an autonomous level of linguistic representation. We review the problems caused by the lack of positive criteria for morphomicity and by disagreements over the application of negative criteria. We present arguments for a learning bias in favour of realization patterns involving natural classes, and we call for greater use of wug-tests and artificial grammar learning experiments in research on this question. Competing morphological theories turn out to be exhibit a surprising amount of empirical overlap, and their implications for the learnability of morphomic patterns are less straightforward than usually assumed.",0
"These lecture notes, used at the LSA 2015 Institute in Chicago and elsewhere, will be periodically updated (and like Don Knuth, I may begin a system of monetary payments for errors spotted!). They are meant to accompany live lectures that provide an introduction to Distributed Morphology and like all pedadogical material, must thereby make certain choices in what to emphasize and distill. The lecture notes will eventually be incorporated into a coauthored project with Karlos Arregi for a textbook on this topic.",0
"Although the discovery of underlying representations (URs) is a complex
task that may be conditioned by various factors (see, e.g., Albright
2002), it has traditionally been claimed to be quite straightforward
when the UR is revealed by productive and transparent morphophonemic
alternations and when there is a clear and regular phonological
condition in the language that justifies the disparities between the
presumed UR and the corresponding surface representation. Among
other possible scenarios (see, e.g., Albright 2008, Kager 2008, Pater
et al. 2012), uncertainty appears when these morphophonemic alternations
do not exist, when they are not fully productive and transparent,
or when more than one interpretation of the UR is possible. This is
the case of the URs of words beginning with ""esC-"" in Catalan, which
we discuss here.

The purpose of this squib is twofold. On the empirical side, we
provide new arguments for the epenthetic nature of the vowel in ""esC-""
words, arising from the interaction between potential word-initial
vowel epenthesis and underapplication of vowel reduction
(VR) in Majorcan Catalan. On the theoretical side,
we show how Majorcan Catalan learners take a ""free ride"" (McCarthy
2005) in the process of constructing the UR of nonalternating forms
involving ""esC-"" initials by generalizing the pattern--and the subsequent
input-output mapping--observed in cases with transparent morphophonemic
alternations and a similar syllabification problem.",0
"This is a first draft. Comments welcome.

In this paper I take a look at a classic problem in Spanish morphosyntax,
namely the alternation between the forms -se and -ra in the Imperfect Subjunc-
tive (Imperfecto de Subjuntivo). Research on this topic has mainly focused on
sociolinguistic variation, and has been done almost exclusively with impression-
istic data and speaker's intuitions. I address the problem from a usage-based
perspective, using corpus linguistics methods. The main claim is that the choice
between -se and -ra correlates to a certain extent with morpho-syntactic and
discourse factors. Through collostructional analysis I also show that there are
repelled and attracted collexemes that distinguish and relate both forms.",0
"We argue that the unusual morphological template in the noun phrase of Meadow Mari should be derived on the basis of an underlying structure that is consistent with standard assumptions about DP syntax and the Mirror Principle. The analysis we propose derives the actual surface order of morphemes in Mari by means of two postsyntactic reordering operations: A lowering operation and a metathesis operation. Evidence for this account comes from a process called Suspended Afﬁxation. This process is known to delete the right edges of non-ﬁnal conjuncts under recoverability. We show however, that Suspended Afﬁxation in Mari does not apply to the right edges of surface orders. Rather, the right edges of an inter-
mediate postsyntactic representation are relevant. Thus, the account we present makes a strong argument for a stepwise derivation of the actual surface forms and thus for a strongly derivational architecture of the postsyntactic module.",0
"This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion of the proper analysis of the clausal region immediately above the verb, by arguing that we need to recognize not just one or two functional heads, but a full layer of structure corresponding to Kratzer (1996)'s Voice or Chomsky (1995)'s v. This layer should include at least four functional heads arrayed above the root as shown below:

Pass > Mid > Trans > Cause > √

The primary evidence for these proposals comes from the Dravidian language Tamil, which is extremely informative due to its highly inflecting, agglutinative nature, and its flexibility in combining together distinct elements traditionally subsumed under the heading of 'voice'. Employing standard Mirror Principle reasoning, we can use the sequences of verbal suffixes that the language supplies to argue not only for an inventory of syntactic heads, but also for a specific hierarchy, due to the rigid ordering restrictions observed.",0
"Departing from an analysis of collective nouns under which they are nouns with a cumulative reference and a count semantic base, but without a uniform atomic level, and hence without a stabile unit of counting, the paper argues that gender, as a near counterpart of classifiers, has a role in specifying the unit of counting. Taking neuter gender in Serbo-Croatian as the absence of gender (Kramer 2009), it is analyzed as a class of nouns which do not morpho-syntactically express the restriction over the unit of counting. In the domain of count nouns, the combination with count semantics yields nouns with non-uniform atomicity. Neuter count nouns are thus argued to be nouns which fail to formally express uniform atomicity, which makes them quantized
counterparts of collective nouns (i.e. quantized, non-uniformly atomic). While the nonuniform atomicity does not affect their singular forms, it is argued that neuter nouns in SC are unable to derive proper plural forms, and that productively derived collective forms are used instead. In other words, all neuter nouns in SC effectively have the status of singulatives – in the sense that they are expressions which refer to singularities and establish contrast in grammatical number with collective rather than with plural forms. A range of puzzling empirical phenomena related to neuter nouns is shown to be straightforwardly resolved by this view of the semantic effects of the absence of gender.
The paper also includes a discussion of Serbo-Croatian collective nouns, showing that their behavior in respect of number agreement triggered on the finite verb and licensing of reciprocal interpretations are determined by whether they are derived from an existing singular base, and whether they remain within its paradigms. Traditional neuter plurals, argued in this paper to be collectives, are shown to pattern in this respect with the collectives braća 'brother.Coll' and deca 'child.Coll', as they all belong to the paradigm of their singular bases, and as expected they all require plural agreement on the verb and license reciprocal predicates.",1
"This article discusses the morphosyntax of accusative subject constructions in Icelandic, from the point of view of the 'dependent case' analysis of accusative. The primary focus is on deriving the Accusative Subject Generalization (ASG), the generalization that accusative subjects are never related thematically to a morphologically intransitive verb. After it is demonstrated that the ASG holds, it is proposed that the ASG follows from the claim that there is no such thing as inherently case-marked accusatives in Icelandic. The accusative subject constructions under scrutiny in fact involve a silent external argument that distributes like a clitic syntactically and is interpreted like a weather pronoun semantically. The account is explanatory insofar as it involves one stipulation-the presence of a silent clitic-from which the ASG and numerous other syntactic, semantic, and morphological properties of accusative subject constructions follow. The explanatory value of the account hinges on a grammatical architecture where morphological idiosyncrasy and semantic idiosyncrasy are computed in distinct components of the grammar, and case marking-even structural case marking-is divorced from DP licensing.",0
"The paper examines syntactic and prosodic constituency within a verbal stem in Czech. Working in the frameworks of Nanosyntax and Strict CV, I argue that syntax to prosody mapping is direct to the extent that prosodic domains correspond to particular syntactic constituents. On the basis of two vocalic alternations, namely vowel zero alternations in verbal prefixes and roots and alternations in vowel length in roots and theme suffixes, I show that the perfective verbal stem represented by a linear string prefix root theme is parsed into three prosodic constituents, [prefix root], [root theme] and [prefix root theme]. These prosodic domains correspond to three syntactic constituents: VP and a lower and higher projection of the theme suffix respectively. The crucial point of the syntactic analysis is that the prefix undergoes phrasal movement: it is generated next to the root in VP and when the theme is added, it moves to its specifier. In the [prefix root] constituent, the vocalization pattern of the prefix is established. The constituents comprising theme suffixes are prosodic domains in which a general rule (called the infinitival template) operates; this rule in effect lengthens underlying long vowels in monosyllabic infinitives.",1
"Ulwa (Misumalpan; Nicaragua) shows a puzzling and unique pattern in which a single
affix marks the head of a possessive noun phrase and appears on roots expressing
property concepts. This pattern has been argued to be semantically motivated by
Koontz-Garboden and Francez (2010). This paper discusses two constructions of Ulwa
that do not receive a natural treatment in their analysis, potentially casting doubt on the
plausibility of a se- mantic motivation for the syncretism. We provide a modified version
of the analysis, in which property concept roots denote mereologically ordered sets of
portions of substance (in the spirit of Link's 2002 treatment of mass nouns), as argued
for in Francez and Koontz- Garboden (2014), rather than property theoretic ones.
Possessive relations are then taken to include mereological ones. Such an analysis not
only retains the motivation for a semantic approach to the syncretism, but also
strengthens it, by showing that the range of interpre- tations available to the allegedly
possessive affix is one expected of possessive lexemes more generally.",0
"To date, there is no comprehensive work on the wide range of phenomena which occur under the heading of contact-induced morphological change. Numerous cases of both derivational and inflectional borrowing have become known during the last few decades, but they are scattered in myriad publications dealing mostly with single languages, such as grammars. Recent efforts to collect the data in unified publications, such as Gardani (2008) and Gardani (2012) for inflectional borrowing, and Seifart (2013) for both inflectional and derivational borrowing, are by far not comprehensive enough. The aim of the paper on which this talk is based, is to provide the first systematic survey of instances of borrowed derivational formatives, from both nominal and verbal morphology, based on evidence from a number of typologically distinct languages.",0
"The striking parallels across languages in the syntactic expression of ""argument structure"" broadly construed has led within generative grammar, at least since Generative Semantics, to generative theories that demand a kind of transparent reflection of argument structure in underlying syntactic representations. This trend is reflected in approaches oriented around thematic roles, such as those that adopt some version of UTAH, as well as event-structure oriented approaches like that in Ramchand 2008 in which, in a sense, event structure is underlying syntactic structure. An alternative approach attributes the relative uniformity of the expression of argument structure to the principles that interpret syntactic structure semantically; here, syntax is truly autonomous, with the atoms of syntactic representations and their relations carrying no semantic values. On this alternative approach, we might expect that the same meanings could be expressed by different syntactic structures and that the same syntactic structures might express different meanings.  

	In this chapter, we present an account of the heads that add participants to events.  Within current theories, these heads are usually identified as voice, appl, and prepositions, as well as little v for some linguists, where the causative little v head might introduce an agent or causer. We will follow Pylkkänen (2008), Harley (2013) and Legate (2014) among others, in arguing that little v does not, by itself, introduce an argument, so our account will focus primarily on the voice, appl, and prepositional heads. We will argue that syntactic heads crucially involved in the interpretation of argument structure – heads like v, voice, p and appl – are subject to contextual allosemy at the semantic interface such that each such head may have a particular range of meanings, including a null (expletive) meaning, depending on the syntactic context. Once syntactic heads are absolved from the necessity of carrying certain features relevant to their interpretation explicitly, when the features are rather computed contextually at the point of semantic interpretation, we can develop a sparse inventory of functional heads for the syntax. The empirical focus of the chapter revolves around Icelandic figure reflexives, Japanese adversity causatives, and possessor raising constructions.",0
"Examining the gender systems in Mainland Scandinavian, I argue that a strict division has to be made between three dimensions of gender: formal gender, semantic gender, and lexical gender. Lexical gender is a salient meaning component of a noun; this dimension of gender is syntactically inert. Semantic gender is a category of thought, basic to human cognition, and conveyed by pronominal resources. Examples of semantic genders are masculine, feminine, countable, non-countable, animate, and non-animate. Formal gender is – synchronically – phonology and thus syntactically inert. This means that there is no Formal Gender Phrase or the like in the syntactic tree. The three dimensions are clearly separate, but they interact, and the pronominal forms associated with the different dimensions are sometimes identical, which blurs the picture.
The formal gender features have basically the same status as the phonological features of a root. Thus, formal gender does not carry any inherent meaning, but may be used for the spell-out of semantic distinctions, for example animate – inanimate. Of particular importance is the idea that neuter is used in Mainland Scandinavian to spell out the absence of number, which accounts for neuter agreement on so-called pancake sentences. A pragmatic effect is that neuter in such contexts corresponds to non-countability. In adjectival agreement, however, formal gender is more or less ornamental. Agreement on adjectives is a phonological wellformedness criterion, and if no other source to agreement is available, agreement will be in formal gender.
Drawing on work done in the 80s (primarily Bosch 1983; 1986; Cornish 1983), I argue that it is necessary to distinguish between pronouns that refer to a linguistic entity, for example a DP, and pronouns that refer to a discourse entity. This is, in fact, what lies behind they properties of hybrid nouns (Corbett 1991), which are cases where the two ways of making reference make use of different pronominal forms. For Swedish the pronouns den (3C) and det (3N) are carefully discussed in this study. It is shown that these pronouns can be used as Syn-pronouns, that is for reference to noun phrases, where the head nouns are formally common gender or neuter, but also as Ref-pronoun, to make reference to countable or non-countable discourse entities.
The analyses are based on Mainland Scandinavian, but an outlook is made to some related languages.",0
"A long line of research takes some sign language loci to be the overt realization of variables. Kuhn 2014 argues that this analysis fails in two cases. (i) First, loci sometimes appear to be inherited through agreement rather than directly interpreted, in particular in those environments in which phi-features are known to remain uninterpreted (= 'Kuhn's Generalization'). (ii) Second, there are cases in which one and the same locus can refer to different individuals, in contradiction with the predictions of the standard theory. Kuhn concludes that sign language loci are an open class of features rather than of variables; and he provides a variable-free treatment of them, although without accounting for their deictic uses. While granting the correctness of Kuhn's Generalization, we offer an alternative in which loci are both features and variables: some loci (in particular deictic ones) obtain their value from an assignment function, and introduce presuppositions on the value of other (covert) variables; but loci are also subject to the same rules of agreement as phi-features, and thus remain uninterpreted in other environments. Finally, we argue that spoken languages also have expressions that are featural while also containing a variable element.

"This paper analyzes two patterns of number marking in DP in Nez Perce (Penutian) within the framework of Distributed Morphology. The first involves under-realization of plural on nouns. Number has classically been understood as a feature inherent to nouns, rather than to adjectives that modify them. In Nez Perce, however, only a small set of nouns show number morphology, whereas number morphology is highly productive on adjectival modifiers. Adjectives in fact may realize the plural more than once per word -- an instance of multiple exponence. I show that the puzzle of under-realization for nouns can be solved through conditioned allomorphy, providing new evidence for the presence of gender features on n (Lowenstamm 2007, Kramer 2014). The puzzle of multiple exponence (over-realization) for adjectives can be solved through Local Dislocation (Embick and Noyer, 2001) combined with very late insertion of reduplicative content (Haugen 2008, 2011), demonstrating one way the DM architecture may produce multiple exponence without recourse to dedicated mechanisms.",0
"This dissertation deals with several related phenomena regarding the interaction of case and agreement across languages. The first part focuses on differential object agreement in Hungarian, where the finite verb always agrees with its subject and sometimes also agrees with the direct object. I argue that both the syntactic structure and the semantic properties of the object are crucial in determining differential agreement. In addition, the morphological realisation of agreement depends on the features of the subject and the object. In inverse configurations, the verb only spells out subject agreement in Hungarian. 

The second part puts the discussion of Hungarian object agreement in a cross-linguistic context. I argue that the phenomenon of ""global case splits"" represents a dependent-marking counterpart to inverse agreement. In global case splits, case-marking of the subject or the object of a sentence depends on properties of the both arguments, not just the argument that is case-marked (or not). Rather than spelling out an inverse marker (or nothing, as in Hungarian) in inverse configurations, the verb assigns a special case-marker to the one of its arguments in global case splits. Such global case splits represent instances of agreement feeding or bleeding case-marking rather than the other way round. I suggest that Case assignment and probing for phi-features are distinct processes, the order of which varies across languages. If Case assignment precedes phi-agreement, global case splits are ruled out; the order makes them possible.

Finally, I sketch aspects of a parameter hierarchy for agreement systems.

"This chapter compares the view that ergative case is an inherent case assigned by v to an NP that it theta-marks (the ICT) to the view that ergative case is a dependent case assigned to a higher NP when there is a lower NP in the same local domain (the DCT). First we present instances in which a nonagent receives ergative case when there is another NP nearby, in applicative constructions in Shipibo, Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic), and Chukchi. Conversely, we present instances in which an agent fails to receive ergative, either because the second NP has been rendered invisible, or because the clause is subsumed within a larger case domain (ECM, causatives). Both data sets support the DCT over the ICT. Finally, we argue that no known language displays a straightforwardly active case pattern-a fact that can be explained by the DCT but not the ICT.",0
"Since all Mayan languages are morphologically ergative, a central question concerns the role that ergativity plays in shaping the syntax. One widely accepted view is that at least those languages which exhibit constraints on the extraction of ergatives are `syntactically ergative'. Here we review the basic facts around ergative extraction in Mayan, surveying both those languages which permit it and those which do not, and identify areas of exceptionality and variation. Central to the discussion are `agent focus' constructions, constructions which permit extraction of the external argument when it is blocked from a canonical transitive clause. We discuss two approaches this constellation of facts – one which holds that constraints on ergative extraction reflect syntactic ergativity and one which holds that they do not.",0
"This article proposes a new approach to restructuring which unites complex head approaches with a bare VP complementation approach. With the former, I argue that restructuring involves incorporation, how- ever, in contrast to complex head (V-V) approaches, I argue that only the voice head of a restructuring complement undergoes incorporation. With the VP complementation approach, I assume that a restructur- ing complement contains a syntactically and semantically independent VP. In contrast to the bare VP complementation approach, however, I propose that restructuring complements also involve a voice head (but no embedded subject). Motivation for a voice head in restructuring comes from the subject interpreta- tion of the embedded predicate, German stem allomorphy, and voice marking in several Austronesian languages. This hybrid account has the advantage that argument structure 'sharing' only applies to the subject of a restructuring configuration, whereas the remaining argument and event structure properties of the matrix and embedded VPs remain separate, which is supported by cross-linguistic properties pointing to the morphological, syntactic, and semantic independence of the two VPs. The account proposed achieves a larger empirical coverage than previous accounts and also improves in several respects on the theoretical details of previous analyses.",0
"In this paper, I aim to provide an account of denominal verbs in English and Romanian that is significantly different from the traditional one resorting to incorporation/ movement (Hale & Keyser 2002). Instead, by assuming that a single label can be used for heads, intermediate projections and phrases, and by resorting to the spell-out of several heads together (Brody 2000, Ramchand 2014, Svenonius 2012, 2014), I adopt the view that a word is a span, and sketch a spanning analysis of denominal verbs which is elegant and economical at the same time.",0
"Humans communicate using language, but they also communicate using gesture – spontaneous movements of the hands and body that universally accompany speech. Gestures can be distinguished from other movements, segmented, and assigned meaning based on their forms and functions. Moreover, gestures systematically integrate with language at all levels of linguistic structure, as evidenced in both production and perception. Viewed typologically, gesture is universal, but nevertheless exhibits constrained variation across language communities (as does language itself ). Finally, gesture has rich cognitive dimensions in addition to its communicative dimensions. In overviewing these and other topics, we show that the study of language is incomplete without the study of its communicative partner, gesture.",1
"In this opening chapter we set the scene by positioning ourselves in the intellectual landscape and spelling out our background presuppositions about language and the mind. After specifying what we mean by the language faculty, we outline our various commitments: to Internalism, Modularity, Minimalism, and Compositionality. We then motivate and sketch the outline of a linguistic theory that satisfies these requirements, arguing in particular for a modular specification, based on a modified Combinatory Categorial Grammar with a merge-based morphosyntax. The aim is to show that under this form of grammar, the syntactic insights of Minimalism and Principles & Parameters theory can be obtained in more restrictive and more explanatory fashion. In particular, we hope that the re-distribution of 'displacement' effects between the combinatorial system and the morphosyntactic system will provide both a simpler overall system, and new insights into human language.",0

"Recent work in Distributed Morphology (DM) proposes an important role for phase theory in constraining special realization of morphemes at the interfaces in contextual allomorphy (Embick 2010) and polysemy resolution (Marantz 2013).1 Our case study on verb-derived agent nominals (VAN) and root-derived agent nominals (RAN) in Icelandic supports this line of research and provides a novel type of argument by showing that Icelandic palatalization applies if and only if the undergoing morpheme is phase-local to the trigger. If our analysis is on the right track, any analysis of segmental phonology like palatalization potentially requires an understanding of syntax and semantics. The findings are interesting because they suggest that surface-oriented phonological processes within a word are constrained by the same universal principles as superficially unrelated phenomena like locality constraints on syntactic displacement; island constraints and palatalization may play by the same rules.",0
"In this dissertation, I investigate the nature of grammatical features and propose that a grammatical feature is split into two halves: one half (uF) that is legible to the morphological component and one half (iF) that is legible to the semantic component. Though these halves in general match up, the values can be distinct or one can be missing altogether. Throughout the dissertation, I investigate various phenomena where the values of the two halves of the feature do not line up, looking at the mass/count distinction, collective nouns in (British) English, and quantified noun phrases in Russian, among others.

I look at agreement that targets the iF value of a feature instead of the uF, which leads to semantically motivated agreement, and I show that this has a different, more restricted behavior than morphologically motivated agreement, operating under different structural configurations. From this difference, I provide a version of Agree that can handle the differences between semantic agreement and morphological agreement. I also discuss the Agreement Hierarchy of Corbett (1979, et seq), where it appears to hold within a single sentence. I show that when two targets agree with a hybrid controller, the targets can mismatch with one agreeing with the iF and one with the uF. Not all mismatches are allowed, a fact that is explained through the timing of agreement.

Furthermore, I show how this view of features allows us to look at the mass/count distinction in a new light. I propose that two classes of atypical mass nouns - fake mass nouns in English and plural mass nouns in Telugu - result from there being a mismatch on the number features of the items, which results in the morphology of the noun having either mass or count behavior (depending on the language), whilst the semantics shows the opposite behavior.",0
"Cross-linguistic data have always been of interest to mental lexicon researchers, but only now are technological developments making it possible to coordinate experiments across languages in a typologically sophisticated way, in an approach we dub meta-megastudies. A meta-megastudy not only tests a large sample of items or speakers but also a large sample of languages, so that partially confounded language-specific variables can be teased apart the way traditional megastudies tease apart partially confounded word-specific variables. Meta-megastudies are made possible by Web-based tools that allow independent research groups to run standardized experiments and share the results.",0
"Vocatives are often considered as exceptions to the regularity of language, and therefore often put ""outside"" of grammar, and pertaining instead to speech.
In this paper, we wish to show that this conceptualization of vocatives in wrong: not only are they perfectly regular, but they give us important insights on the grammatical architecture of language. We will consider a case-study, namely central and southern Italian vocatives, which are obtained by truncation, to show that: 1. Deixis and reference are to be kept separate. 2. Speech-act related information is encoded in syntax, but on a different dimension than core argumental syntax. 3. This dimension is targeted by prosody. 4. There would be no other way that grammar could be built, given the inviolable constraint imposed by prosody because of the fact that it cannot apply without underlying phonological segmental material.",0
"In their recent contribution, Wiese and Speyer (2015) come forward with a very interesting proposal regarding the effect of supra-lexical prosody on word prosodic structure. The proposal, the simplicity and elegance of which is captivating, is this: when given the choice, speakers strive for a rendition that maximizes prosodic parallelism; for two words that are prosodic phrase mates the foot structures are preferably parallel, i.e., the feet have the same number of syllables and stress pattern. This reply is a critical appraisal of Wiese and Speyer (2015).",0
"This paper presents a reanalysis of the Chukotkan prefix ne-, analyzed by Comrie (1980) as an inverse prefix. The distribution which Comrie took to constitute an inverse patterning (in which the object outranks the subject on a person hierarchy) is present in Itelmen as well, but only epiphenomenally, when both passive and active transitive paradigms are considered together. This observation suggests an alternative, diachronic source for the Chukotkan prefix's distribution, resulting from heteroclisis-neutralization of an original active/passive distinction (maintained in Itelmen) to create a single, combined paradigm. This neutralization also provides a plausible historical source for the Chukotkan ergative construction, as argued by Fortescue
(1997).",0
"I analyze the Spanish indefinites algún and algunos as a paucal and a greater paucal determiner, respectively, contrary to the common assumption that views the former as singular and the latter as plural. I use Harbour's (2014) feature [±additive], and the possibility of repeating that feature, in order to do so. I propose a transparent word-internal compositional analysis of the two determiners, where alg- contributes [−additive] to both of them. I discuss consequences for the semantics of morphological plurality in nouns and for the analysis of ignorance implicatures.",0
"This thesis is a study of the Wolof clausal periphery, focusing on the morphosyntax of the two layers commonly identified as CP and TP, covering two larger topics: the nature of the C-T link, and the interaction of syntax and morphology (post-syntax) in the CP-TP layer.  
It has long been noted that C and T are not completely independent of one another, but share a host of properties. Wolof clausal periphery is highly relevant for the advancement of our understanding of the C-T link, as Wolof clauses contain overt sentence particles – complementizer-like elements argued to encode information-structural properties of utterances, which interact in various ways with the elements traditionally thought to occupy the TP-layer. Wolof provides interesting type of evidence for the C-T link, as in some of its clause-types C and T appear not to be heading two separate projections, while they display the traditional C-T division in other clauses.

The first main claim of this dissertation is that features commonly associated with C and T start out on a single head, which can either remain unified, or be split into two heads (as already implemented in various ways in e.g. Chomsky 2005, 2007, 2008; Richards 2007, 2001; Fortuny 2008; Ouali 2008). To capture the fact that in Wolof, as well as in many other languages, features occurring on C and T are not doubled on the two heads, I propose a highly derivational model of head-reprojection, which relies on hierarchically  organized features on the unified CT head, and a strict order in which they must be checked (as in, e.g. Manetta 2006, Georgi & Müller 2010, Müller 2010). I identify circumstances in which only parts of the CT head, dominated by a feature that, for well-defined reasons, could not be checked, split off and remerge in a higher position, thus yielding the traditional C-T split. 

The second major topic of the dissertation concerns the interaction of the syntactic and the post-syntactic component of the grammar. By inspecting the morphosyntactic reflexes of A'-movement and the behaviour of inflectional morphology in V-to-C raising in Wolof, I show that much of the apparent syntactic variation can be attributed to cross-linguistically common morphological processes taking place in the post-syntactic component of the grammar, thus following a growing body of research concerned with the details of the syntax/post-syntax interface (e.g. Arregi & Nevins 2012). In the process of uncovering the specifics of this interaction in Wolof, I argue for a much more interactive syntax-morphology interface than is commonly assumed, which allows for outputs of the post-syntactic component to be fed back into syntax and participate in further operations. 

The main contribution of the dissertation is a demonstration of how a more refined view of both syntactic elements smaller than the word (i.e. features) and of morphology and its interaction with better understood syntactic processes offers a new way of approaching surface variation in the syntactic component. I ultimately argue that syntax is cross-linguistically very uniform, even if we look at a strongly discourse-configurational language such as Wolof.",1
"In this paper, we return to the original empirical domain of the EPP, i.e. the requirement that certain subject positions be overtly filled, and argue that characterizing it in terms of a syntactic movement-triggering feature is an oversimplification, and indeed is misguided. The phenomenon described by the EPP in fact turns out to be quite challenging from a theoretical standpoint, as its properties look countercyclic under standard Minimalist models of grammatical architecture. The constraint describing the relevant ill-formed structures requires reference to phonological information, yet the mechanism that typically avoids violations of this constraint, i.e. movement to subject position, bears all the hallmarks of being a syntactic operation. Thus it looks like we have a syntactic operation triggered by phonological considerations, which is countercyclic. A novel approach to the EPP is thus required, which can handle its sensitivity to phonological factors, yet still fits in with our broader theory. This paper is intended as an initial contribution in this direction.",0
"The South Baffin dialect of Inuktitut exhibits an apparent person restriction that bans 1st/2nd person (though not 3rd person) agreement morphology from co-occurring with oblique case. I argue that, contrary to surface appearances, this phenomenon is not actually a restriction on 1st/2nd person features; rather, it is a byproduct of moving the phi-features out of the agreement head and into the head hosting oblique case. The broader theoretical claim is that feature movement is a possible means of valuation by Agree.",0
"This paper addresses the question whether postsyntactic ordering mechanism that rearrange morpheme orders (as local dislocation in distributed morphology (DM) can be dispensed with, with morpheme orders following from the syntactic derivation. It does so by testing the Huave dataset of Embick and Noyer (2007) which served to motivate  postsyntactic local dislocation. It develops an analysis in an antisymmetric framework with no postsyntactic rules, building on the results of Cinque's 2005 work on Universal 20 patterns (patterns which generalize to other syntactic hierarchies (Cinque 2009). 
The local dislocation analysis is shown to have to take as its input a syntactic representation that must be rejected on Huave internal grounds as well as on universal grounds. The U20 approach is shown to yield the patterns of grammaticality and ungrammaticality directly on the basis of the primary evidence and an independently motivated hierarchy. The U20 approach further makes a prediction about what can vary (the data seems to be underdetermined as to the relative order of merge), and shows how  allowing the location of merge to vary, directly captures dialectal variation in morpheme orders of two Huave dialects.",0
"The observed pronunciations or spellings
of words are often explained as arising
from the ""underlying forms"" of their morphemes.
These forms are latent strings that
linguists try to reconstruct by hand. We
propose to reconstruct them automatically
at scale, enabling generalization to new
words. Given some surface word types
of a concatenative language along with the
abstract morpheme sequences that they express,
we show how to recover consistent
underlying forms for these morphemes,
together with the (stochastic) phonology
that maps each concatenation of underlying
forms to a surface form. Our technique
involves loopy belief propagation in a natural
directed graphical model whose variables
are unknown strings and whose conditional
distributions are encoded as finitestate
machines with trainable weights. We
define training and evaluation paradigms
for the task of surface word prediction, and
report results on subsets of 7 languages",0
"This thesis connects two strands of inquiry. The first is an investigation into the form and determination of minimalist (Chomsky 1995) parameters, whose nature is uncertain compared to the well-defined principles and parameters approach of Chomsky (1981). One prominent approach (termed ""lexicocentrism"") confines variation to the features of heads in the lexicon, which, though minimal, places a significant acquisitional burden on the learner, and appears to predict unstructured variation, despite typological and diachronic evidence to the contrary. Roberts & Holmberg (2010), Roberts (2010c, 2012 et seq.) suggest these problems may be resolved if structure is provided by domain-general learning principles, which combine to create emergent hierarchies of microparameters. I develop this suggestion in detail, proposing a domain-general algorithm for categorisation and feature assignment which is applied to a number of toy linguistic examples.

The second strand concentrates on a specific area of syntactic variation: that of focus expression. This area exhibits vast diversity, with structures not only differing significantly across languages, but also within them. Moreover, most previous attempts to describe these differences either fail to account for the full range of variation seen, or rely heavily on the notion of construction. I suggest that two components are necessary to break these constructions down into their constituent heads. Firstly, I take focus to be unified by the invocation of alternatives (Krifka 2007), and building on Rooth's (1985, 1992, 1996) theory of alternative semantics, I argue that focus constructions may be described as an abstract relation between an expression and its alternatives. Secondly, a null hypothesis of compositionality allows these descriptions to shed light on syntactic structure. This approach is demonstrated for focus constructions in English, Nepali, ASL, LSB, and BSL, and the resulting analyses are shown to be acquirable by the domain-general algorithm, providing a new perspective on parameterisation.",0
"Affixation and allomorphy are often phonologically predictable: thus, the English indefinite ""a"" appears before consonants, and ""an"" before vowels. We propose a theory of phonological selection that separates rules of morpheme realization from phonological knowledge about the bases and the derived words. This phonological knowledge is encoded in miniature phonotactic grammars, which are learned over sublexicons defined by morphological generalizations. Each sublexical phonotactic grammar determines the likelihood that a new word will follow the associated rule. We examine a complex case of suppletive allomorphy in Russian, whose diminutive suffixes define sublexicons differing in constraints on final consonant place and manner, presence and location of consonant clusters, vowel hiatus, and stress. In elicitation, Russians choose allomorphs for words without diminutives based on how these words and the derived diminutives fare in the sublexical phonotactic grammars. In a nonce word study, Russians also chose allomorphs based on sublexical phonotactic well-formedness, even when the phonotactic violations were non-local to the affix itself. These patterns are missed by alternative approaches such as emergence of the unmarked, insertion rules that refer directly to phonological information, and the Minimal Generalization Learner.",1
"In this dissertation, I show that a difference in structure between functional and lexical items has a restricting effect on both the morphology and the phonology. Morphologically, we observe two asymmetries: (i) in lexical nouns, number-driven root-suppletion is common whilst case-driven root-suppletion is virtually unattested; (ii) in contrast, pronouns commonly supplete for both number and case. By and large, we see the same pattern in verbs, observing a contrast between lexical verbs and auxiliaries with regard to suppletion for aspect and tense. In order to account for these asymmetries, I appeal to structural differences between lexical and functional material, combined with locality effects as proposed in Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1993). Crucially, lexical material contains a category-defining node which has a delimiting effect that causes case/tense to be insufficiently local to the root to condition its suppletion. In contrast, functional material lacks category-defining nodes and thus no delimiting effect is observed and case/tense are free to condition suppletion of the functional base. Phonologically, we see a correlation between the presence of a category-defining node and the absence of dominant prefixes in vowel harmony and lexical accent, whilst in the absence of a category-defining node dominant prefixes are attested. Thus, I argue for universal limitations on suppletion patterns and dominant prefixes, which crucially derive from a difference in morpho-syntactic structure between lexical and functional material.",0
"This paper argues that phonological conditions can be satisfied not only by word-internal morphological and phonological repairs but also by repairs in the syntactic domain across word boundaries. Evidence is drawn from a range of phonologically-conditioned syntactic phenomena. A survey of such phenomena demonstrates that instances of phonologically-conditioned syntactic behavior have crucial analogies to more familiar and common phenomena of phonologically-conditioned morphology. In addition, two case studies from corpus analyses of spoken American English are presented to further demonstrate that syntactic repairs--specifically, alternations of word order or construction choice--can be used in satisfying phonological constraints. Together, the survey and case study results presented here show that the apparent differences that arise between phonologically-conditioned morphological and syntactic alternations can be attributed to locality and domain effects, of boundary size and of prosodic/segmental levels. This suggests that phonologically-conditioned syntactic behavior may simply be a more extreme relative of phonologically-conditioned morphology, under a view of comparative grammaticality.",0
"This paper aims to work toward a proper understanding of the role of
preverbal ge- in Old English and its disappearance in the course of Middle English. This prefix is reminiscent of its cognates in Modern German and Dutch 
in its distribution, but even a cursory examination of the details reveals it to be quite distinct, as we will see. The proper characterization of that distribution, and of its diachronic development, has proven to be extremely difficult. I have thus carried out a large-scale corpus study using the York-Toronto-Helsinki parsed corpus of Old English prose and the Penn-Helsinki parsed corpus of Middle English, 2nd ed. This paper will report the results of the first phase of the project, involving patterns in the data that could be identified primarily on the basis of automatic searches in the corpora. These patterns serve as the empirical basis for an improved description of the facts, and ultimately for a more precise theoretical hypothesis about the nature
of ge- than any found in previous work. I will propose specifically that ge- in OE was the default realization of a res(ultative) head in the sense of Ramchand (2008).",0
"The main purpose of this paper is to provide a novel account for Wh-Concord in Okinawan based on the Copy Theory of Movement and Distributed Morphology. We propose that Wh-Concord interrogatives and Japanese-type wh-interrogatives have exactly the same derivation in the syntactic component: the Q-particle -ga, base-generated as adjoined to a wh-phrase, undergoes movement to the clause-final position. The two types of interrogatives are distinguished in the post-syntactic component: only in Wh-Concord, the -r morpheme on C triggers Morphological Merger, which makes it possible to Spell-Out lower copy of -ga. It is shown that the proposed analysis correctly predicts three descriptive generalizations on the distribution of -ga in (i) syntactic islands, (ii) subordinate clauses, and (iii) (embedded) multiple wh-interrogatives.",0
"This paper presents new data pertaining to the Anaphor Agreement Effect (originally noted in Rizzi 1990 and showing that anaphors in many languages seem to be unable to trigger ``normal'', i.e. phi-covarying agreement) from the Dravidian language Tamil. On the one hand, this data further supports the AAE as a robust crosslinguistic generalization. On the other hand, it shows that Tamil employs a hitherto unobserved strategy to avoid a violation of the AAE, which not only expands on the typology of parametrized strategies used by languages to avoid AAE violations but also shows that the descriptive conditions on the AAE need to be updated in light of this new data.

"In this paper I argue that a subpattern of Irish plural allomorphy should be analyzed as output optimizing in character. Specifically, I claim that stress-sensitive alternations between the plural suffixes -(e)anna and -(e)acha are conditioned by constraints on metrical well-formedness. This analysis connects with independent facts about the the prosodic prominence of [ax] sequences
in Irish phonology. I further argue that an explanatory analysis of these patterns must make use of the notion of surface optimization. Alternative frameworks that eschew surface-oriented optimization mechanisms fail to account for synchronic and diachronic properties of the Irish plural system.",0
"Modified noun phrases like heavy drinker and hard worker show many of the same properties 
as bracketing paradoxes like nuclear physicist, but seem to differ from the latter examples in important ways. This paper argues that hard worker-type phrases should be analysed as bracketing paradoxes, where the syntactic structure is isomorphic to the PF structure, unlike nuclear physicist-type examples, where syntax and LF are isomorphic. I propose that hard worker-type paradoxes, or verbal bracketing paradoxes, result from a process of rebracketing at LF, which can be seen as a type of movement. This movement, and indeed all movement, is constrained by a principle of Information Preservation, which ensures that certain aspects of structural information are not destroyed during movement. The result is an analysis that accurately captures the facts about bracketing paradoxes of both types in English and Dutch.",0
"We argue that instrumentals and comitatives are the mirror image of dative/genitive obliques. We propose that both sets of adpositions/cases are elementary predicates, expressing a part-whole (inclusion/possession) relation. Comitatives/instrumentals reverse the direction of the relation with respect to datives/genitives; genitives/datives embed the whole/possessor, instrumentals/comitatives embed the part/possessum. In other words the genitive, dative and instrumental obliques result from the internal differentiation of a single core content – namely the part-whole content expressed in fairly uncontroversial fashion by the genitive. We apply this proposal to triadic verb constructions, where the comitative/instrumental alternates with dative. We extend our discussion to dative/instrumental syncretism (eventually including DOM objects) and to ergative alignments, addressing the most widespread patterns of syncretism of the ergative morpheme, with either instrumentals or genitives/datives.",0
"In my PhD thesis, I put forward an account of the intricate morphosyntactic pattern displayed by the causative-inchoative alternation and some related construction(s). Inchoatives, causatives, and two overlooked, but closely connected Hungarian constructions, the 2DPC and the half-passive, are shown to line up along an (in)transitivity scale, and the constructions with varying degrees of (in)transitivity are brought under a unified analysis on the premises of progressively growing syntactic structures. The assumption that morphemes have an internal syntactic structure allows me to capture morphological diversity, speaker variation and a puzzling morphology vs. syntax/semantics mismatch in an elaborate morphosyntactic account.",0
"Novo mesto Slovenian, a South Slavic language, exhibits a process of unstressed /i/-deletion that appears to be construction-specific: it applies in verbs and participles, but not in other word classes, such as nouns or adjectives under identical phonotactic conditions. This thesis proposes a phonological analysis of this deletion process, which determines that the masculine plural exponent /-i/ may attach to a participial stem, as in [ptc]-/i/, and undergo deletion under specific phonotactic conditions, but it may also attach to a nominal or adjectival stem, as in [adj]-/i/, where it is preserved in the same phonotactic conditions in which it deletes with participles. This process of construction-specific vowel deletion cannot be derived by the standard approaches to construction-specific phonology, such as Cophonology Theory (Orgun 1996; Inkelas et al. 1997; Inkelas & Zoll 2007; Inkelas 2008, 2011), or the grammar with phonological levels (Cyclic/Word/Phrase level) as in Embick (2013), which stems from Halle & Vergnaud (1987) and effectively mirrors Lexical Phonology (Kiparsky 1982a,b; Mohanan 1986). The problem is rooted in the way these approaches define phonological domains. A system with the fixed distinction between Cyclic and Word levels is shown to be inadequate. This thesis subscribes to the research program laid out in Marvin (2002), Marantz (2007), Samuels (2009), Piggott & Travis (2013) and Newell & Piggott (2014), which seeks to interpret the phasal cyclicity of syntax (Chomsky 2001, 2008) as a locality boundary that defines phono- logical domains. It is shown that a simple generalization on the /i/-deletion facts can be formulated by making reference to phases as phonological spell- out domains. In addition, this thesis proposes a tentative formal solution to the problem of deriving the deletion of the masculine plural /-i/: since the deletion effect is specified in the stem to which the /-i/ attaches, it is proposed that the phonological grammar stores phonology-specification in a buffer, which may persist to the end of the spell-out domain as set by the phase. Through this, the stem-specified deletion phonology effects the masculine plural suffix /-i/.",0
"In this paper, I show that two distinct mechanisms are needed to account for the pattern of noun-adjective agreement in Noon (Cangin, Senegal). Previous work presupposes that the same mechanism derives noun-modifier agreement (concord) and argument-predicate agreement: usually a modified version of Chomsky's (2001) Agree. However, others have argued that noun-modifier agreement is morphological in nature and should be derived post-syntactically. Here, I argue for a split approach: one form of Noon adjective agreement is derived by valuation of φ-probe on A, while another is derived via a post-syntactic process of Feature Copying (Norris 2014).",1
"A probe H interacts with feature F by copying F back to H. A probe H is satisfied by feature G iff encountering G terminates further probing by H. 

In this short paper, I introduce the distinction between interaction and satisfaction and give an argument that interaction and satisfaction features need not be the same. A probe may interact with the entire phi-set even though it is only satisfied by one particular phi-feature. Empirical evidence comes from complementizer agreement in Nez Perce, where the C probe interacts with all phi-features but is only satisfied by the feature [ADDRESSEE].",0
"The Nez Perce verb agrees with the subject and the object in person and number. This paper considers the full paradigm of verb agreement in transitive clauses, documenting a series of previously undescribed restrictions on the use of agreement affixes as well as extended uses of originally non-agreement morphology as part of the agreement system. Data is drawn from systematic elicitation of four transitive paradigms. Two full paradigms are presented in the appendix.",1
"Romance languages mostly exhibit uniform agreement patterns: the finite verb shows full agreement with the subject; the modifiers agree with the head of a noun phrase, and past participles agree with promoted and clitic objects in those Romance languages that display participial agreement. There are however some exceptional agreement patterns, which will be examined here.This chapter is divided into three main parts. The first concerns agreement restrictions or oddities on Romance pronouns and pronominal clusters, the second looks at some agreement facts in verb/argument structures, and the third one examines agreement restrictions/oddities within the DP.",0

It is shown that the reanalysis of the aphaeretic form of the distal demonstrative as the article CEL, through a grammaticalization process that regularly took place in the emergence of Romance determiners, strongly correlates with the diachronic specialization of Romanian demonstratives and with other syntactic changes taking place across-the-board in the Romanian DP.",0

"This paper reports the fact that the morpheme that expresses the plurality of individuals and the one that expresses the plurality of events or actions are the same derivational reduplicant in Mandarin Chinese. It is seen in AABB nouns and AABB verbs. Thus, an instance of cross-categorial quantification is attested morphologically. With respect to word formation, the fact can be explained if the reduplicant is combined with a base first and then a functional element is merged with the combination, and the categorial features are projected from the functional element alone (categorization). Thus, not only roots, but also derivational affixes, can have no categorial features. As a consequence, the existence of acategorial plural markers indicates that number features can be integrated not only after categorization, realized as inflectional affixes or functional elements, but also before categorization, realized as derivational affixes. The same is true of gender and animacy features, cross-linguistically.",0
"This article addresses the problem of crosslinguistic rarity by mapping
the types of diachronic factors that contribute to the rarity of a particular feature.
It is proposed that a number of different diachronic factors may play a role, such
as the rarity of source constructions, the rarity of particular types of change, the
number of stages necessary for a particular feature to develop, and the number
of pathways that can lead to a particular feature. This article looks at a rarissimum
of person marking, namely, a zero-marked feminine 2nd singular person
index in the Sahidic dialect of Coptic (Afroasiatic; Egypt). It is argued that such
markers are rare because they presuppose rare input structures, and most
processes of change would lead away from – rather than to – zero-marked 2SG.
Furthermore, this study identifies a diachronic process in which a PART of a
morpheme is reinterpreted as a segmentable morpheme (in this case, a person
index), thereby leading to the loss of a zero person marker. This is the converse
of the well-known ""Watkins' Law"", in which a segmentable person marker is
reinterpreted as part of a base.",0
"In Seereer (Atlantic, Senegal), singular pronominal objects are obligatorily realized as an object suffix on the verb. This paper provides the first comprehensive description of this object suffixation pattern, a topic that has been only cursorily described in the extant literature on Seereer (cf. Renaudier 2012). In addition, I provide a preliminary theoretical account of the Seereer object suffix system. I argue that Seereer object suffixes are best analyzed as incorporated pronouns. Evidence for such an analysis comes from the following: (i) an object suffix may never occur with an in situ object DP; (ii) an object suffix may not double an extracted object in relative clauses, wh-questions, or focus constructions; (iii) there is only one object suffix allowed per clause; and (iv) an object suffix may reference either object in a double object construction. I argue that object suffixes raise to Spec-vP and are subsequently incorporated in the verb via m-merger (Matushansky 2006, Kramer 2014, Harizanov 2014). This analysis elegantly derives the behaviors listed above. Such an approach also allows us to integrate the Seereer object suffixation data into the broader understanding of cliticization patterns crosslinguistically, thereby enriching our understanding of object marking systems in verbs.",0

"Deriving prosodic structures is devoted to explicating and exploring prosodic structure formation in relation to syntax. To achieve this, it compares and contrasts empirically attested prosodic constituency patterns of a number of syntactically diverse structures. By investigating parts of words, words, mono- and multi-worded phrases, root clauses, parentheticals, and structures employed as speech acts, this book presents a stepwise analysis of the procedure of mapping from syntax to prosody. It also provides an extended discussion of which syntactic structures correspond to which prosodic structures. Following the basic assumptions of Distributed Morphology and Match Theory, this book claims that only certain heads and projections of narrow syntactic structures (those with a phonological exponent) are mirrored in the prosodic constituency. It also argues that certain prosodic interface categories (e.g. prosodic words and certain intonational phrases) are not generated as the result of mapping from syntax. Rather, they emerge from conditions on prosodic well-formedness. To account for such cases of 'mismatch', a limited 'indirect access' account is endorsed, in which prosodic constituency is partially faithful to syntax, and the constituency is simplified as a consequence of applying the rules of the prosodic grammar, which is partly universal and partly language-specific.

Deriving prosodic structures is of interest to scholars working on the interfaces of syntax, morphology and prosody. It covers topics such as prosodic word formation, acoustic differences between phonological phrases and intonational phrases, the generation of prosodic (non)prominence, prosodic recursion and its absence, phonologically null morphemes and how they are represented in phonology, illocutionary force bearing structures, discourse level embedding of clauses, and the acoustic realisation and the syntactic behaviour of parenthetical structures.",0
"In this work, I argue that the so-called inverse agreement pattern observed in the Algonquian language Plains Cree is, in fact, a system displaying the more common typological feature called dierential case marking, inuenced by an intrinsic salience hierarchy built into the grammar. By re-analyzing the direction markers of Plains Cree as case markers, I assert that there is no (stipulative) morpho-syntactic feature of the type {INV} as assumed in previous work.",1
"Minimalist approaches often implicitly assume a version of the Case Filter (Chomsky 1981, Vergnaud
1977), whereby, even in languages without morphological case, overt DPs must be Case-licensed.1
'Case' thus potentially accounts for the distribution of (referential) DPs and motivates phenomena such
as A-movement (passivization, raising and, for some, Control). Recent proposals, however, have
argued for the parameterisation (Harford Perez 1985, Markman 2009, Diercks 2012) or rejection of
abstract Case (Marantz 1991, McFadden 2004, Landau 2006). The time seems ripe, then, for a
reconsideration of: (i) the diagnostics for abstract Case, (ii) their cross-linguistic validity (especially in
languages without morphological case) and (iii) how they can be accounted for in an explanatory way.
In the following, we attempt to address (i)-(iii). Section 2 introduces six Case diagnostics and
applies them to six languages with little o morphological case: Mandarin, Thai, Yoruba, Jamaican
Creole (JC), Luganda and Makhuwa. Section 3 provides an account of why Luganda (like some other
Bantu languages) appears to lack 'the abstract Case property' (in a descriptive sense). Building on this,
section 4 then provides a novel account of nominal licensing based on the idea that nominals must be
part of a complete phase. Finally, section 5 concludes.",0
"[Joint work with Dana NICULESCU]

This study analyzes the position occupied by pronominal clitics in the clause with respect to the verb in old Romanian (OR) on the basis of an extensive corpus analysis of 16th – 18th century texts. The corpus analysis shows that, from the earliest texts, OR pronominal clitics are attested in second, third, fourth, etc. position in the clause, and exceptionally also in first position. Therefore, they do not fully observe the Tobler-Mussafia Law, which was in function in other old Romance languages. OR pronominal clitics are IP-clitics, which can be placed both in pre- and in postverbal position (proclisis and enclisis). Due to the gradual reduction of V-to-C movement, pronominal proclisis generalizes.",0
"This paper brings diachronic and synchronic evidence for the claim that the Parameter of Definiteness coined by Danon (2010) is active in the syntax of the Romanian nominal phrase. We analyze the status of the definiteness feature in the typology of grammatical features put forth by Kibort (2010), and show that definiteness is realized as a grammatical suffix and behaves like a morphosyntactic feature in Romanian as it is involved in syntactic agreement and, marginally, in licensing. The morphosyntactic nature of definiteness opens the way towards a proper parameterization. We then thoroughly discuss the patterns of definiteness realization which indicate that the definite article starts low, as a suffix on the noun (as chiefly shown by the ""low definite article"" of Old Romanian identified by Cornilescu and Nicolae 2011a), and its (sometimes multiple) realization is driven by Agree.",0
"Work on the syntax-semantics interface has been at odds to explain two seemingly unrelated issues: factivity effects and the nature of clausal complementation. I show that we need look no further than basic selectional requirements: new data and generalizations from English, Hebrew, Greek, Persian and American Sign Language reveal a systematic difference between verbs of different kinds which reduces to whether they select for an entity (a DP) or a proposition (a CP).

I argue that some verbs select for a definite entity, translating into a CP embedded in a covert DP layer; and some select for a proposition, being simply a CP. The former are factive, the latter nonfactive. In addition, all verbs that select for a DP can embed a factive complement. A definite complement triggers not only factivity but also leads to differences in interpretation in a predictable manner, thus uniting the two issues of interest.

The resulting syntactic analysis of matrix predicates and embedded clauses feeds semantic and discursive effects, bridging assertions, presuppositions and referential propositions. It also allows us to account for additional, as-yet-unexplained generalizations such as the factivity and nominalhood of sentential subjects, correctly predicting when they would be nonfactive.",0
"We characterize Romance inflectional class morphology in Nouns as endowed with a semantic content, providing evidence about its active involvement at the syntax-semantic interface. We argue that the so-called neuter of Central Italian dialects involves coding of the mass/count distinction, which can in turn be interpreted as the reflex of a more primitive property, opposes non-individual content to instances of individual denotation. Indeed the -o 'neuter' inflection of Central Italian varieties is compatible not only with mass nouns but also with eventive contents and with the invariable inflections found with perfect participles of unergative/transitive verbs. We show that mass vs. count semantic content is available in other Indo-European languages and in genetically unrelated languages through nominal class morphology
supporting the idea that nominal class is a classifier.",0
"Morphology is language specific and must be acquired on the basis of particular linguistic data. This chapter addresses three central issues for the understanding of morphological acquisition: the distributional properties of morphology, the mechanisms of learning from data, and the developmental patterns and trajectories in child language. First, corpus studies of child directed language reveal a systematic pattern of data sparsity: in general, only a (small) fraction of possible morphological forms will be attested in the acquisition data. The child learner, then, must be able to form wide ranging generalizations from early on, and on very partial corners of the morphological paradigm. Second, we review evidence from morphological development, especially the study of English past tense, and draw two broad conclusions: (a) morphologically complex forms appear not memorized by association but are learned in relation to their morpho-phonological classes, lexicalized or otherwise, and (b) as far as child language is concerned, morphological productivity appears categorical, where children often over-use productive processes but almost never commit analogical errors. Third, we situate morphological learning models in the context of language acquisition, where psychological considerations pose additional challenges and constraints. The child must proceed in an incremental and unsupervised fashion, which deprives them of assumptions (such as stem and derived pairs) that are taken for granted in theoretical analysis. Along the way, we discuss how language acquisition may provide useful insight for the theoretical study of morphology.",0
"This paper presents a nanosyntactic account for negation in what is referred to as le bon usage French (Grevisse and Goosse [1936] 1993, Rooryck 2010) and in colloquial French.  The analysis captures the obligatory presence of ne and pas for the expression of sentence negation in le bon usage French, whilst also accounting for the loss of ne in colloquial French. The difference between ne and pas in le bon usage French boils down to a structural difference: ne consists of only one feature or syntactic layer, a polarity feature, whereas pas consists of four features, focus, degree, quantity and proper negation. Only the combination of these five features can yield what is conceived of as sentential negation. With respect to colloquial French the analysis involves that the syntactic structure of pas, encoded in a post-syntactic lexicon, starts spelling out five features, thus making ne redundant for the expression of sentential negation. Given that the use of negative markers in le bon usage French and colloquial French represents two important and well-described stages in what is referred to as Jespersen's Cycle (Dahl 1979) this account is also relevant from a diachronic perspective.",0

"This essay claims that pronouns are constructed as syntactic relations rather than as discrete feature bundles or items. The discussion is set within the framework of a minimalist Context-linked Grammar, where phases contain silent but active edge features, edge linkers, including speaker and hearer features. An NP is phi-computed in relation to these linkers, the so established relation being input to context scanning (yielding reference). Essentially, syntax must see to it that event participant roles link to speech act roles, by participant linking (a subcase of context linking, a central computational property of natural language). Edge linkers are syntactic features–not operators–and can be shifted, as in indexical shift and other Kaplanian monster phenomena, commonly under control. The essay also develops a new analysis of inclusiveness and of the different status of different phi-features in grammar. The approach pursued differs from Distributed Morphology in drawing a sharp line between (internal) syntax and (PF) externalization, syntax constructing relations–the externalization process building and expressing items.",1
"Contemporary debates in morphological theory center around to what extent the phonological exponents of word structures reflect discrete morphological categories or are instead realized in such a way that syntactic/semantic categories may not be localized in any one phonological matrix. Evidence from Tonkawa overlapping templatic slots, mobile inflectional prosodic morphology and other templatic dependencies suggest that prominent morphemic and amorphous theories understate the complexity of the issue: there exist morphological categories between words and phrases.",0
"Cowper (2005) presents an intriguing theory of number features in which she suggests that plural is more marked than dual, contrary to perceived wisdom (Corbett, 2000). This claim has been rebutted by Nevins (2007). In this squib I revisit the debate on number with data from Onondaga (Iroquoian), which support Cowper's analysis of number. Doing so, I tease apart the notion of structural markedness and typological markedness. The results of this investigation show, as Cowper did, that plural is structurally more complex than plural; however, this does not imply that plural is typologically more marked than plural. Thus, the Nevins' arguments that dual is more typologically marked than plural still hold, even though plural is structurally more complex than dual. The broader implication here is that structural complexity and typological markedness are not necessarily correlated.",0
"This paper explores the structure of complex verb stems in Mi'gmaq (Eastern Algonquian) by investigating noun incorporation (NI). In Mi'gmaq, there are at least two different synchronically productive constructions that can both be superficially called ""incorporation"" - Medial/Stem-internal Incorporation and Denominal Verbs. 

In this paper I compare the two constructions and show that they differ structurally, but are similar in that the incorporated element in both is categorized (i.e. a noun), which occupies the lowest head in the structure. 

The proposed analysis provides an in-depth look into morphology in Mi'gmaq, situated within the generative syntactic framework of Distributed Morphology (DM) (Halle and Marantz 1993; Marantz 1997). More broadly, this study advances our understanding of how words are built up in polysynthetic languages by supporting a case-by-case approach: two given constructions may be called ""NI"", but they may also have different syntaxes.

Ultimately, this study shows that when all word formation is done in the syntax the difference between noun incorporation and compounding becomes not so clear.",0
"This paper argues that the English Past Tense and (so-called) PerfectAspect are morphosyntactic variants of the same underlying operator.This is motivated by the old observation that Past Tense and thePerfect Aspect have, in English, two obvious things in common.  Thefirst is anterior-time semantics; both 'John left' and 'John has left'locate an event of John's leaving in the past with the respect to thetime of their utterance. The second observation is morphological; thelexical verbs in the two sentences above are inflected identically. Ofcourse, the challenge in pursuing this analysis lies in thenon-totality of these similarities.  While the Past and PresentPerfect are, truth-conditionally identical in some contexts, they aredistinct in others.  Additionally, for certain verbs, like 'eat', themorphology is not identical either.

This paper focuses on the morphosyntactic challenges that this accountfaces.  We argue that the present perfect consists of a Past Tensescoped over by a Present Tense; likewise the Past Perfect ('John hadleft') of two Past Tenses stacked, and perfects under modalauxiliaries ('John must have left') or in infinitival contexts aresimply instances of a Past Tense as well. After briefly outlining asemantics which can account for divergences like the one mentionedabove, we elaborate on the following morphosyntactic proposal: Pasttense requires that the verb after it bear an inflectional feature,which is spelled out as '-en', as in 'eaten'.  However, a verb whichcarries both this feature and a finiteness feature spells out as'true' past morphology, as in 'ate'; but these two forms are syncreticfor some verbs.  Finally, the presence of multiple functional heads inthe TAM domain (e.g., two tenses) can trigger feature conflict andtherefore dummy-verb insertion.  Since the finiteness feature whichtriggers true past morphology only appears on the highest verb in afinite clause, dummy-verb-insertion prevents this feature fromreaching the lexical verb.",0

"This paper offers new evidence confirming the lexicalist view that, in contrast to phrasal expressions, products of the word-formation component of languages such as German are predisposed to accomplish the naming function of the mental lexicon. For this purpose, we will investigate newly formed adjective-noun compounds, e.g., 'Hochlampe' ('high_lamp'), 'Rotdach' ('red_roof'), and their potential to function as lexical labels as well as their capacity to represent names for kinds. The affinity of compounds to be lexicalized and their tendency to undergo semantic specialization will be traced back to the markedness of novel compound expressions, which will lead to a pragmatic analysis along the lines of Levinson's M-principle. A parallel design for word-formation and syntax as two distinct domains of grammar will be implemented, in which recursive structure building capacities are shared, but with specific configurational restrictions holding in each domain as well as distinct functional profiles.",1
"This chapter argues that split ergativity is epiphenomenal, and that the factors which trigger its appearance are not limited to ergative systems in the first place. In both aspectual and person splits, the split is the result of a bifurcation of the clause into two distinct case/agreement domains, which renders the clause structurally intransitive. Since intransitive subjects do not appear with ergative marking, this straightforwardly accounts for the absence of ergative morphology. Crucially, such bifurcation is not specific to ergative languages; it is simply obfuscated in nominative-accusative environments because there, by definition, transitive and intransitive subjects pattern alike. The account also derives the universal directionality of splits, by linking the structure that is added to independent facts: the use of locative constructions in nonperfective aspects (Bybee et al. 1994, Laka 2006, Coon 2013), and the requirement that 1st/2nd person arguments be structurally licensed (Bejar & Rezac 2003, Baker 2008, 2011, Preminger 2011, 2014).",1
"We present a constraint-based multiple-grammar approach to learning and productively applying morphophonological alternations, with a focus on non-local and non-concatenative phenomena, based on the sublexical approach (Becker & Gouskova to appear). Success of the model is demonstrated on the English plural and English past tense data sets, among a variety of others. We compare our model to the rule-based Minimal Generalization Learner, showing our model's ability to handle a wider range of morphological patterns. Our model contrasts with constraint-based proposals that use abstract underlying representations to generate surface forms in a single grammar; we show that shifting the locus of complexity from the representations to the grammar allows learning from realistically large and noisy data.",0
"Some classic generative analyses (Jelinek 1984, Baker 1996) predict that polysynthetic languages should be non-configurational by positing that the arguments of verbs are marked by clitics or affixes while overt NPs/DPs are relegated to adjunct positions. Here I argue that the polysynthetic Uto-Aztecan language Classical Nahuatl (CN) was actually configurational. I claim that unmarked VSO order was derived by verb phrase (vP) fronting, from a base-generated structure of SVO. A vP constituent is evidenced by obligatory movement of indefinite object NPs with the vP, as in pseudo noun incorporation analyses given for VOS order in other predicate-initial languages such as Niuean (Polynesian) (Massam 2001) and Chol (Mayan) (Coon 2010). The CN case is interesting to contrast with languages like Chol, which lack head movement, in that the CN word order facts show the hallmarks of vP remnant movement (i.e., the fronting of the verb plus its determinerless NP object into a position structurally higher than the subject), while the actual morphology of the CN verb shows the hallmarks of head movement (including noun incorporation, tense/aspect/mood suffixes, derivational suffixes such as the applicative and causative, and pronominal agreement prefixes marked on the verb). Finally, in regard to the landing site for the fronted predicate, I argue that the placement of CN's optional clause-introducing particle ca necessitates adopting the split-Comp proposal of Rizzi (1997), as is suggested for Welsh by Roberts (2005). Specifically, I claim for CN that ca is the head of ForceP and that the predicate fronts to a position in the structurally lower Fin(ite)P.",0
"Gender is a highly understudied category in formal approaches to language. It bears in an illuminating way on a number of central issues, including the syntax-morphology interface, the division of labor between narrow syntax and the externalization component (""PF""), lexicalist vs. non-lexicalist approaches to syntax and the nature of pronouns, abstract down-top Agree vs. overt top-down agreement, (co)reference, edge features, control vs. movement, and the context linking of grammar. In addition, gender (as other central categories of grammar) lends support to the general idea that discernible (visible, audible, tactile) linguistic material is kept together by invisible ""dark matter"". This paper discusses these and related matters, focusing on gender in Icelandic.",0
"The agglutinative morphology of verb stems poses many problems for theory and analysis, insofar as distinct theoretical commitments as to what counts as a linguistic unit do not always align. The verb stem morphology of Jóola-Eegimaa ((Eegimaa, henceforth), an Atlantic language of the Niger-Congo family, poses just such a challenge.  We argue that our analysis, which relies on several operations that rearrange the underlying syntactic structure of the verb stem in Eegimaa, permits the various demands of syntax, semantics and morphology to receive a unified analysis for which there is striking empirical support. Insofar as the success of our analysis depends on core minimalist assumptions, our approach supports not just the minimalist approach in general, but also has implications for the copy theory of internal merge, for the typology of head movement, for the role of syntax in the derivation of words before surface morphological operations, for the nature of surface morphological operations, and for the compositional and de-compositional analyses and interpretation of the verbal spine. In particular, we make an existence argument for a form of stem-internal long head movement that any revealing analysis of Eegimaa verb stem structure will require. We also briefly explore the possibility that the operations that underlie stem-affixation and interpretation in Eegimaa may provide a window into some of the vexing morphosyntactic complexities found in other agglutinative languages.",0
"Are syntactic categories like noun and verb categories of stems, such that the noun and verb versions of ambiguous stems like hammer are distinct, though related, lexical items, or are syntactic categories carried by affixes attached to uncategorized roots, such that noun and verb versions of ambiguous stems are derived forms built on a single root? This paper addresses the representational question posed by syntactic categories by examining the processing of category ambiguous words. If syntactic categories are in fact categories of stems, category ambiguity should yield processing uncertainty parallel to that engendered by other forms of lexical ambiguity, such as homophony. On the other hand, if syntactic categories result from affixation, category ambiguity should yield processing uncertainty parallel to that engendered by syntactic uncertainty, at least if morphological structure reduces to syntactic structure as claimed by Distributed Morphology. A magnetoencephalographic (MEG) experiment exploiting a single word lexical decision task supports the syntactic over the lexical account of syntactic categories; category ambiguity parallels syntactic ambiguity rather than lexical ambiguity. The paper illustrates how neurolinguistic data can contribute to testing competing representational theories, but only when tight linking hypotheses are motivated connecting linguistic theory, cognitive processing, and neural responses.",0
"The interaction of prosody - including both segmental and tone melody - with syntax and semantics in Niger-Congo languages has been extensively treated in phonological terms (Downing, 2006; J. L. Smith, 2011). This paper shows that approaching prosodification through the lens of syntax yields both empirical and theoretical benefits. Empirically, attending to the syntax of prosodification provides insight into the structure of the lexicon across the Niger-Congo language family. Most notably, it permits a formal account of the relation between regular and ideophonic vocabulary items. Theoretically, it forces a re-conceptualization of the prosody-syntax and prosody-semantics interface, as well as the syntax-semantics interface. In particular, it challenges one of the tenets of Distributed Morphology, namely that the entire lexicon is category-less (Embick & Marantz, 2008). More broadly, it also challenges the Saussurean dictate that the relation between form and meaning is always arbitrary. Finally, it confirms the architecture proposed in the model of Interface Syntax (Wiltschko & Déchaine, 2010), which correctly predicts that prosody can associate directly with syntactic or semantic atoms, namely both phono-syntactic (sound-category) and phono-semantic (sound-meaning) bundling is attested.",0

"This paper explores the claim that combinatorial patterning developed in Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL) through segmentation and sequencing of holistic gestures accompanying speech (Senghas, Kita, & Özyürek, 2004). I suggest an alternative interpretation of the NSL data and argue that segmentation alone, while a prerequisite for combinatorial patterning, does not constitute evidence for combinatorial structure. I additionally point out the discrepancy that arises when attempting to reconcile the changes in NSL with existing evidence on sign language morphology more generally. The omnipresence of simultaneous morphology in the world's sign languages (Aronoff, Meir, & Sandler, 2005) suggests empirical inadequacies with the original account of the NSL data, in which the development of sequencing was attributed to a universal bias for linearization (Senghas et al., 2004). I propose that sequencing in early NSL actually reflects an intermediate stage in the language's development from simultaneous-holistic to simultaneous-combinatorial representation. Drawing from linguistic analyses of simultaneous morphology in American Sign Language (Supalla, 1982), I show how simultaneous-combinatorial patterning might be expected to manifest in NSL and outline a set of specific predictions for its emergence. These predictions find empirical support in evidence from sign languages' historical development (Aronoff et al., 2005) and their acquisition by children (Newport, 1988). The paper concludes by showing how my account, but not the original, captures the modest differences between second- and third-cohort NSL signers' representation of motion events, suggesting that the change to simultaneous-combinatorial patterning may already be underway.",0
"The present article takes a quantitative approach to investigating contact-induced

subordinate indigenous language, Coptic (Afroasiatic). Based on the high
prefixing score of Coptic and the much lower prefixing score of Greek, it is concluded

While Dryer's 659-language convenience sample does not turn up any
clear example of such a construction, we argue that this is in part due to arbitrary
coding choices that a priori exclude potential constructions of this type. In
order to document the existence of adverbial subordinator prefixes, we present
a number of languages with different genealogical and areal affiliations, each of
which shows solid synchronic evidence for what appears to be a universally
dispreferred feature. Furthermore, we identify some diachronic pathways
through which adverbial subordinator prefixes grammaticalize.",1
"Tagalog adjectives and nouns variably occur in two word orders, separated by an intermediary linker: adjective-linker-noun versus noun-linker-adjective. The linker has two phonologically-conditioned surface forms (–ng and na). This paper presents a large-scale, web-based corpus study of adjective oun order variation in Tagalog, focusing in particular on phonological condi-tions. Results show that word order variation in adjective-noun pairs optimizes for phonological structure, abiding by phonotactic, syllabic, and morphophonological well-formedness preferences that are also found elsewhere in Tagalog grammar. The results indicate that surface phonological information is accessible for word order choice.",1
"Morphosyntactic and syntactic variability is often ignored in syntactic theory. One reason has to do with assumptions about what variability is, and how the interfaces between syntax, the morphology, and the semantics are configured. I sketch out this argument, and show that the technology that Minimalist syntax currently employs to capture syntactic dependencies actually gives us, for free, not only a technique for capturing intra-personal variability, but also a means to model frequency effects in this domain.",0
"Why can't we say ""the asleep cat""? There is a class of adjectives in English, all of which start with a schwa (e.g., afraid, alone, asleep, away etc.), that cannot be used attributively in a prenominal position. A frequently invoked strategy in language acquisition research is indirect negative evidence. For instance, if the learner consistently observes paraphrases such as ""the cat that is asleep"", then the conspicuous absence of ""the asleep cat"" may be a clue for its ungrammaticality (Boyd & Goldberg 2011). In this article, we provide formal and quantitative evidence from child directed English data to show that such learning strategies are untenable. However, the child can rely on positive data to establish the distributional similarities between this apparently idiosyncratic class of adjectives and locative particles (e.g., here, over, out, etc.) and prepositional phrases. With the use of an independently motivated principle of gener- alization (Yang 2005), the ungrammaticality of attributive usage can be productively extended to the adjectives in questions.",0
"The main claim in this dissertation is that copy deletion, null subjects and ellipsis form a natural class of phenomena, all being the result of a morphosyntactic operation: I-Assignment, a transformation that adds an Identity feature ([+I]) to phrases or heads. The PF effect of I-Assignment is blocking the Lexical Insertion rules that otherwise would automatically apply in the maximal domain of the morphological component: morphosyntactic words. The definition of this process is given in (1):
Non-Insertion:
(1)	No Lexical Insertion Rule, IR, applies in the domain of X0, X0 a MWd, if X0, or some projection of  X0, is specified with a [+I] feature.

I-Assignment -seen as the counterpart of F-marking- is triggered by a single formal identity condition and by some structural conditions that are either syntactic or morphological. Identity is defined as a formal condition on abstract features and Roots. So, it is just strict syntactic identity. I-Assignment applies in an all the way fashion. Concretely, it can apply at every point of the derivation from syntax to PF. At syntax, I-Assignment affects phrases under syntactic conditions such as selection or c-command, whereas at morphology I-Assignment affects heads (morphosyntactic words in Embick & Noyer' 2001 terms) under the same conditions that restrict affix hopping and other post-syntactic displacements (e.g., adjacency). The rationale behind this system is that there are no independent morphosyntactic configurations licensing ellipsis. 

I will claim that competing theories of ellipsis have to be evaluated with respect to their descriptive power for covering a broad set of apparently unrelated phenomena. I will show then that, in this regard, a cyclic theory of ellipsis with focus on the syntax/PF interface is able to provide an explicit answer to questions regarding the grammatical conditions that regulate (non)-pronunciation, the objects that can be affected by ellipsis, and the set of deducible interactions among such silent objects and other morphosyntactic phenomena. Among other set of problems, the I-Assignment system, I argue, derives (a) why a copy or a potential ""null subject"" has to be pronounced, even when identity is satisfied, (b) why in some cases, but not in others, agreement feeds ellipsis, (c) why phrasal copies, but not head ones, can obviate the identity condition on ellipsis, (d) why partial identity exists (e.g., vehicle change and morphological sloppy identity) and (e) why there are cases of movement in ellipsis structures that are not attested in non-elliptical contexts.",0
"This paper proposes a new deletion analysis of [t]-zero alternations in Ajyininka Apurucayali (often cited as 'Axininca Campa'). It is argued that the analysis assuming /t/-deletion fares better than an insertion analysis in two respects. First, the insertion analysis predicts an unattested stem type for verbs. Second, the insertion analysis fails to capture a generalization about hiatus resolution whereby vowel sequences undergo deletion, shortening, long vowel formation, or diphthong formation in a set of morphologically unrelated environments. The deletion analysis relies on the notion of preservation of the marked (de Lacy, 2006) and utilizes an independently motivated stratal organization of Apurucayali phonology in accounting for restrictions on verbal stems. The proposed analysis has important implications for the typology of epenthesis.",0
This is a review of David Pesetsky's LI monograph 'Russian case morphology and the syntactic categories'.,0
"We propose an adjunction-based analysis of comparative (and similar) constructions that captures the morphological and semantic relation between comparative heads (e.g., -er, as) and comparative clauses (e.g., those headed by than or as). Primarily motivating this proposal are the syntactic similarities that we observe between comparative constructions and other adjunction structures in grammar. Specifically, we propose that comparative clauses adjoin to the extended projection of the NP or VP containing the comparative morpheme, and enter into an agreement relation with that morpheme. This agreement relation is the overt morphological reflex of the head of the comparative clause taking scope over, and semantically valuing an implicit argument introduced by the com- parative morpheme. We argue in detail that such a proposal is to be preferred over classic alternatives that posit a complementation rather than adjunction relation, such as Bresnan (1973) and Bhatt and Pancheva (2004). Our account captures the data motivating these alternatives, as well as familiar and novel data that such accounts do not predict.",0
"In this paper we show that some of the Kx'a, ǃUi and Taa languages have a plural strategy involving a prefix with the shape kV-. We first document the phenomenon for each language where it exists. Then we discuss the commonalities between the plural prefix in the various languages and suggest that it has been inherited from a common ancestor which we call Proto-Kx'a-ǃUi-Taa. We discuss whether or not the existence of this prefixal plural in the various languages could have been the result of borrowing, and conclude that borrowing scenarios are not generally plausible. We conclude that the plural prefix in Kx'a, ǃUi and Taa provides support for the existence of Proto-Kx'a-ǃUi-Taa.",0
"It is shown that NSR and CSR can be generalized into Non-Head Stress or Bottom Stress. I point out that Non-Head Stress and Bottom Stress have problems of head stress in adjective-noun pairs. I argue that we can solve the problems of generalized stress rules in terms of restrictiveness of modifiers. Stress falls on the restrictive modifier, which is in the same NP with the head and is branching because of implicit alternative modifiers. Stress does not fall on non-restrictive modifiers, which are the specifier of Nominal Phrase (NomP) dominating the NP containing the head noun at the bottom of the whole structure. Then, we can keep generalized stress rules that apply to all types of phrases and compounds. Finally, I suggest the possibility of deriving the generalized stress rules from Restrictive Stress.",0

"In many languages a linker element is inserted between a noun and an adjective that modifies it or a (genitive) complement that the noun embeds or a relative clause (not considered here). The Albanian article has the crucial distribution, namely before adjectives and genitives.

Aromanian has a different series of oblique introducers, which agree with the following (genitive/dative) noun (the possessor) rather than with the possessum (the head noun in a genitive construction). On the basis of morphological evidence, but also of syntactic and interpretive evidence, we argue that linkers (at least in the languages considered) are closest to what is usually called agreement. The key theoretical question is why agreement structures would surface in the form of definiteness morphology, namely articles in Albanian and demonstratives in Aromanian. Our claim is that so-called agreement morphology is an inflectional-level saturation of argument places. The Agree rule therefore matches pairs of interpretable elements concurring to the saturation of the same argument slot.",0
"This chapter posits a parameter hierarchy to capture micro-parametric variation in ergative (or rather non-accusative) alignment, building on the proposal that ergative is an inherent case, assigned by (a subset of) little vs (Levin 1983; Woolford 1997, 2006, amongst others). Initial parameters determine the distribution of this inherent case across instances of little v in a given language, sensitive to various thematic features, and subsequent dependent parameters determine further properties of ergative-assigning vs such as the presence of a movement trigger and the suppression of structural Case features. This gives rise to a number of distinct ergative types depending on (i) the distribution of ergative case, (ii) the presence/absence of syntactic ergativity and (iii) the source of absolutive case in transitive contexts. The resultant parameter hierarchy serves to restrict the space of variation, modelling a number of proposed implicational universals in this domain, and provides a potential solution to the subset problem in acquisition by encoding a notion of relative markedness. The dependencies (rankings) between the parameters in question, it is argued, stem from a version of the Case Filter, and the need to create convergent derivations. (Descriptively) all transitive thematic heads have the ability to assign a structural Case as a default (generalised Burzio's generalisation) but this possibility can be switched off, for principled reasons, where the head in question both (a) assigns a thematic (inherent) case and (b) bears an EPP movement trigger.",0
"Since the establishment of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993), readjustment rules have been a central tenet of the theory. Readjustment is a post-Lexical-insertion phonological operation triggered on certain Vocabulary Item by some aspect of the morphosyntactic context (e.g. a vowel change on a noun Root like mouse, triggered either by the [PL] feature of Num0 or  the null affix exponent inserted to express the [PL] feature of Num0, to yield an output of mice). This process-based aspect of a syntacticocentric theory is quite odd, however, given DM's otherwise ""piece-based"" (Item-and-Arrangement) orientation. Various DM practitioners seem to have adopted readjustment as a necessary evil, even while bringing to the fore its problematic aspects; see, e.g. Harley and Noyer's (2000:133) observation about stem suppletion, that any theory that could allow radical stem readjustments (e.g. deriving worse from bad) ""could presumably do anything""; and Embick and Halle's (2005:60)  piece assumption (where, ""all other things being equal, a piece-based analysis is preferred to a Readjustment Rule analysis when the morpho-syntactic decomposition justifies a piece-based treatment""). Some recent work in DM (see, e.g., Siddiqi 2006, 2009; Bermúdez-Otero 2012; Bye & Svenonius 2012; Haugen and Siddiqi 2013; Kilbourn-Ceron et al. this volume, etc.) has called into question the necessity of readjustment rules, and a variety of different approaches can perhaps indeed obviate them. The purpose of the present paper is to raise the metatheoretical question of whether or not readjustment (i.e. the alteration of stem phonology after lexical insertion) is needed for any morphological theory. The conceptual and empirical domains investigated here include: (i) the employment of readjustment rules as ""secondary exponence"" phenomena; (ii) verb stem allomorphy in the Uto-Aztecan languages Hiaki (Yaqui) and Classical Nahuatl; and (iii) verb stem allomorphy concurrent with reduplication in the Oceanic language Sye (Erromangan). The most cogent argument in favor of readjustment rules over stem-listing approaches invokes the frequent phonological regularity of stem alternants (e.g., Harley and Tubino Blanco's 2013 analysis of stem form alternations Hiaki). I adopt an alternative analysis whereby such regularities can be just as felicitously explained by appealing to historical linguistic processes rather than to readjustment rules applying in the synchronic grammar. This discussion thus falls under the purview of what Kiparsky (2006) has described as an ""amphichronic program for linguistic theory"".",0
"We explore whether the observation that AP-modifiers precede PPs in noun-initial DPs (Giurgea 2009, Adger 2013) requires a structural analysis. We suggest that a linear account is better suited to deal with data from head-final and head-medial languages, and in fact from noun-initial languages as well. Our analysis is based on a parallel with the syntax of objects, namely the fact that while SOV languages systematically allow scrambling, SVO languages tend to be subject to case adjacency.",0
"It is shown that in Lithuanian negation can trigger the replacement of the accusative case marking of the direct object by the genitive not only locally but also across a potentially unbounded number of infinitival clauses. This phenomenon is investigated from the point of view of verbs that allow it and possible blocking factors, on the basis of both elicited and corpus data. Areal parallels in Slavic and Baltic Finnic languages are discussed, too.",0
"This paper explores the distribtuion of Old Hungarian infinitives that bear a 3SG ending but have a non-3SG subject. I call these infinitives 'anti-agreeing infinitives'. I argue that their inflection arises as a result of default agreement, and show that this type of agreement is not attested with infinitives that have a referentially independent subject.",0
"The paper offers an autosegmental approach to Polish palatalizations whereby the presence of palatalizing features is the result of the translation of morpho-syntactic features into phonological features. In the first part I present an analysis of the structural change of the relevant palatalizations, which boils down to the account of how floating autosegments are integrated into the underlying structures of the stem-final segments. The second part is preoccupied with how relevant autosegments are inserted into representation: the palatalizing floating features are phonological 'halves' of vocabulary items matching the feature sets marking inflectional categories in Polish. The paper finishes with the discussion of the distribution of the endings -i/y and -e as  the markers of the Dative and Locative in one of the declension classes in Polish. I show that the approach advocated here fares better at predicting the distribution of the said endings than the better established approach presented in Gussmann (2007).",0
"A brief rejoinder to a book and summary article by Vyvyan Evans, pointing out some of the more egregious errors of understanding, representation and fact.",0
"We argue that clauses that are marked with evidential morphemes are ORIGO-centered and have presentative force. Clauses with evidential marking present, but do not assert, an ORIGO-centered proposition. This presentative hypothesis makes a number of claims. Syntactically, clauses with presentative force are a distinct clause-type, and so contrast with declaratives, interrogatives, and imperatives. Semantically, clauses with presentative force contribute not-at-issue propositional content (Potts, 2007): they are independent of descriptive content, they hold of the ORIGO's utterance situation, and they are perspectival. Pragmatically, evidential clauses update the ORIGO GROUND, and so interact in predictable ways with the COMMON GROUND, the QUESTION SET, and the TO-DO-LIST. Because of their ORIGO index, presentative clauses overlap with indexicals (if the ORIGO is 1st/2nd person) and with logophors (if the ORIGO is a 3rd person matrix subject). We test these claims with data from English, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Plains Cree, and show that several diagnostics reveal the existence of the ORIGO GROUND, including grounds for endorsement/challengeability, ORIGO shifts, and faultless disagreement. Consequently, languages don't really differ in whether they have grammaticized evidential morphemes. Rather, they differ in default illocutionary force and perhaps in whether they have morphemes that specifically mark presentational force.",1
"Syntax of Dutch, a major linguistic research project currently based at the Meertens Institute Amsterdam, will be published in at least seven volumes over the period 2012-2016. The work is co-authored and edited by Hans Broekhuis. The aim of this publication is to present a synthesis of the available knowledge of Dutch syntax. It is primarily concerned with language description and not with linguistic theory, providing support to all researchers of language and linguistics, including advanced students.

The three volumes ""Verbs and Verb Phrases"" discuss the internal make-up and distribution of verb phrases and clauses. After a general introduction covering various non-syntactic issues including inflection and tense marking, Volume 1 provides an extensive discussion of argument structure and verb frame alternations (passivization, middle formation, dative alternation, etc.). Volume 2 is devoted to various types of verbal/clausal complements in complex clauses, and includes discussions of controle, verb clustering, etc. Volume 3 contains discussions of adverbial modification and the organization of the clause, and provides an in-depth description of Dutch word order (verb movement, various forms of wh-movement, scrambling, extraposition, left and right dislocation, etc.). 

The downloadable sample (100p.) describes the Dutch tense system on the basis of Henk Verkuyl's Binary Tense theory; the sample will also empirically ground Broekhuis & Verkuyl's claim that Dutch does not express future tense by syntactic or morphological means (NLLT 32:973–1009): it will be amply illustrated how future readings are derived by pragmatics means. Readers will look in vain for a reaction on Kissine's critique on Broekhuis & Verkuyl's article in NLLT, as his objections do not bear on any of the theoretical claims made in that article.",0
"In this study, we undertook an experiment in which native speakers of Akan were given serial verbs both with and without oblique non-verbal elements (such as relator nouns, direct objects, postpositions, etc.) and asked them to construct Serial Verb Construction Nominals (SVCNs) from them. We found that, by and large, when not given said non-verbal elements, speakers were not able to construct nominal forms. In another task, we gave speakers nominal forms and asked them to deconstruct them to the constituent serial verbs from which they were derived. Time and again, speakers gave, not only the serial verbs, but also the non-verbal elements even though they were not asked to do so. Gestalt meanings were also given by speakers when asked the meanings of individual elements. Thus, the semantic integration and lexicalization that takes place in full lexicalized-integrated serial verb constructions extends, not only to serial verbs, but also to these non-verbal elements which, to native speakers, seem to form just as important a part of the SVC as the verbal elements. Thus, we argue that definitions of SVCs, henceforth, should not prejudice the serial verbs to the detriment of other equally important parts of the construction.",0
"In Moroccan Arabic, like in many other Afroasiatic languages, a single noun may have more than one plural form. For instance, tʕəsʕwera 'photo' has plurals tʕsʕawər and tʕəsʕwerat. Morphologically speaking, these are genuine plurals referring to what Semitists commonly call broken and sound plurals or internal and external plurals. From a semantic perspective, however, sound plurals indicate a definite number usually occurring with numerals, whereas the corresponding broken plurals have collective readings. This study presents an interface approach which aims to determine the structural location of number and capture the empirical contrast between broken and sound plurals. It is argued that the sound plurals are associated with the standard Num projection, whereas the broken plurals are associated lower in the structure with the n projection. External evidence for this analysis is drawn from the phenomenon of emphasis spread. The nP is presented as the maximal domain of emphasis spread in nouns.",0
Commentary on Ambridge et al. (2015) on frequency effects in language acquisition,0
This article surveys the ways in which the various interfaces interact to express information structure in Malayalam. It focuses on how syntactic notions such as clefts and focus markers like `mathram' and –`ee' V+`ulluu' interact with each other and with prosody to express focus in similar but different ways and how topic is encoded via syntactic processes such as scrambling and topic markers and via different prosodic patterns.,0
"Taking as my starting point the existence of categoryless roots within the syntactic tree, I propose a theory in which such roots are rendered categorial through their syntactic context, be it their immediate functional domain or their immediate morphological categorial domain.  For example, T (or Asp) would suffice to make the root V-equivalent, and an affix such as -ation which selects V (and projects N) would suffice to make its complement domain, when root, V-equivalent.

Within such an approach, there is no need for a specialized null n,v,a nodes, and much of the paper indeed argues directly against the existence, not to mention the proliferance, of such null categorizers, with English syntax, morphology and lexical semantic serving as the case under investigation.",0
"This chapter provides an overview of the status of overt and null subjects in Spanish,
Catalan, European Portuguese and Italian. The two main Minimalist approaches to null
subjects imply that either: (a) the verbal morphology in null subject languages (NSLs) is
pronominal (Barbosa 1995, Alexiadou & Anagnostopoulou 1998); or (b) a pronominal,
which in some circumstances can be null, functions as the subject in these languages,
(Sheehan 2006, Roberts 2010 amongst others). Crucially, these two approaches make very
different empirical predictions regarding the status of overt subjects in pre- and postverbal
position as well as the (non-)existence of null expletives, the exploration of which forms
the basis of this chapter. Interestingly, it seems that while an (a)-type approach is more apt
for some Romance NSLs, others require a (b)-type analysis. The role of the interfaces with
morphology and information structure in licensing null subjects is also discussed.",0
"This paper proposes an analysis of unagreement, a phenomenon involving an apparent mismatch between a third person plural subject and first or second person plural subject agreement observed in various null subject languages (e.g. Spanish, Modern Greek and Bulgarian), but notoriously absent in others (e.g. Italian). A cross-linguistic correlation between unagreement and the structure of adnominal pronoun constructions suggests that the availability unagreement depends on the independent syntactic representation of person and definiteness (Greek emeis *(oi) foitites vs. Italian noi (*gli) studenti 'we (the) students'). It is argued that unagreement results from null spell-out of a head hosting person features high in the extended nominal projection of the subject. In languages with pronominal determiners, encoding both person and definiteness on the same head, a general restriction on silent definite determiners also restricts null spell-out of person features to otherwise silent nominals. This analysis provides a principled explanation for the cross-linguistic distribution of unagreement and suggests a unified framework for deriving unagreement, adnominal pronoun constructions, personal pronouns and pro.",0
"Metaphony in Ariellese, an Italo-Romance variety of the Abruzzese group, targets masculine nouns, and is neither only morphological nor only lexical: it is instead the result of a synchronic phonological process, consisting in adding a mora to the word to express the plural morpheme. This mora needs to be linked to a segment. The stressed vowel, being the most prominent unit, is the obvious candidate. More specifically, the chosen segment is the most sonorant element in the nucleus, i.e. the |A| element. In order to keep a correct syllabic structure, |A| will need to be detached from its original mora. The result will be both the realization of the remaining element in the stressed syllable, bearing a metaphonic ""effect"" and, when in phrasal configuration, the realization of the |A| element in the extrametrical position.",0
"Nez Perce is one among many ergative languages that consistently use nominative case, rather than ergative, for 1st and 2nd person transitive subjects. For the synchronic grammar of this type of ergative split, two major lines of analysis have been proposed. Morphological analyses approach the phenomenon as a case of syncretism between ergative and nominative in 1st and 2nd person; all transitive subjects are assigned an identical syntax. Syntactic analyses posit a featural or structural distinction between 3rd person subjects and 1st and 2nd person subjects, or the clauses containing them. On the basis of modification and coordination patterns, I argue that person-based split ergativity in Nez Perce requires a syntactic analysis. Comparison of the Nez Perce data with recent findings by Legate (2014) reveals variation among languages showing person-based split ergativity: some languages require a morphological analysis, and some (like Nez Perce) require a syntactic analysis. A treatment of the syntactic type of person-based split ergativity is proposed, making use of person-sensitive phrase structure as introduced by Bianchi (2006) and Merchant (2006).",0

"The Science of Language (SoL) disputes the relevance of natural selection, the absence of a directing force in evolution, the presence and role of genetic variation, and the scientific method. In essence, SoL's subtext is that Noam Chomsky has refuted the Darwinian theory of evolution and forged a new model for scientific enquiry. In place of the methods of modern science, SoL praises the 'rationalist' views of Platonists and seventeenth-century philosophers, which may explain why Chomsky, disputing Darwin, firmly holds to the view that there must be directing principles behind evolution. ough God is never mentioned in the volume, some form of magic must have spread Merge throughout humankind if, as Chomsky asserted in 1972, natural selection has 'no substance'.",0
"The goal of the present contribution is to explore what kinds of objects languages are from a biolinguistic point of view. I define the biolinguistic point of view as the scientific study of languages (an abstract biology of languages) and I show that from this point of view, languages are human language organs, that is, they are natural objects. However, languages change over time; therefore, they are also historically modified natural objects. Considering that natural organisms are also historically modified natural objects, I look for inspiration in evolutionary theory to better specify what kinds of objects languages are and how they change and diversify themselves. I consider some alternatives to this conception, especially those functional and cognitive approaches that view languages as cultural objects and I present a

comparison between the two points of view with regard to the extent of linguistic diversity. I conclude that every language is a unique evolutionary history. This conclusion means that although the structure of languages reveals aspects of formal elegance (as the minimalist inquiry has shown) and aspects of functional efficiency (as shown by the obvious fact that they are usable for thought and communication), there are no arguments to state that

these aspects are manifested more or less intensely in some languages than in others. Then their formal and functional aspects are part of what is common to all languages, while variable parts of language are a reflection of the essentially historical nature of our language organs.",0
"In Zeijlstra (2012), it was argued that the syntactic operation Agree can only take place between a probe that carries an uninterpretable feature and a goal that carries a matching interpretable feature when the goal is the closest potential goal that c-commands the probe. Similar ideas have been proposed by Wurmbrand (2012a,b, 2014). This version of Agree has been dubbed Upward Agree (UA), as opposed to Downward Agree (DA, where the probe c-commands the goal). Zeijlstra argues for UA on the basis, first, that some instances of syntactic agreement can only be analyzed as instances of UA (i.e. they cannot be analyzed as instances of DA); and second, that it is possible to analyze all other instances of Agree as instances of UA. These latter cases include both long-distance φ-agreement and Agree-driven movement effects (""EPP"" effects), which have elsewhere been discussed as evidence in favor of DA.
UA has received some criticism, most notably by Preminger (2013), who presents and discusses two cases of long-distance φ-agreement, one from Tsez (Polinsky and Potsdam 2000), and one from substandard Basque (Etxepare 2006, Preminger 2009, 2011, 2013). Preminger argues that these instances of long-distance agreement cannot be accounted for by Zeijlstra's proposals, and so argue against a redefinition of Agree in terms of UA.
This paper addresses the question of whether UA can account for cases of apparently ""downward"" φ-agreement, including phenomena such as long-distance agreement. Contra Preminger, we argue that the conclusion that UA is untenable as a universal mechanism for agreement is unjustified – rather than suggesting that the UA proposal should be weakened, we argue that the apparent counterexamples to UA vanish once we adopt a more restrictive version of UA. We argue that this more restrictive version of UA, slightly modified from Zeijlstra (2012), is in fact uniquely able to account for notable asymmetries between upwards and downwards φ-agreement. These asymmetries include a typological link between downwards φ-agreement and Case, as already suggested by Baker (2008), and the observation that downwards φ-agreement is often in some sense defective as compared to upwards φ-agreement, as observed going back to work on Spec-Head feature checking, and noted in connection to the UA debate by Bjorkman (2011). We also show that this novel version of UA fares better in explaining EPP-effects.",1
"This is an overview article attempting to introduce core concepts of syntax to non-syntacticians. It is a much shortened and much revised version of lingbuzz/001990.

Syntax is the cognitive capacity of human beings that allows us to connect linguistic meaning with linguistic form. The study of syntax is a huge field that has generated a great deal of empirical and theoretical work over the decades. This article outlines why understanding our syntactic capacity is important to cognitive science in general and why the data of syntactic research is to be taken seriously. It them provides an overview of a number of broad findings about the character of the syntax of human language, including evidence for abstract constituent structure, core properties of constituents, the importance of functional categories, the link between syntactic structure and meaning, and the range of types of syntactic dependencies, including dependencies of form, dependencies of position, and dependencies that create new meanings.",0

"Adjectival meanings in Telugu are typically expressed by composing Property Concept (PC) nouns or roots (Dixon 1982) with the entities they modify using possessive mor- phosyntax and a copula to form stative predicates. PCs also compose with a variety of light verbs (LV), to form causative and non-causative change-of-state (CoS) predicates, based on the type of the LV. There are no deadjectival verbs in Telugu, instead PC-LV complex predicates are productively employed to express these meanings.
The restrictions on which PC nouns and roots can occur with which LVs reveal more about both the PC noun or root denotations and the LV argument structures.",0
"Categories may be functional or lexical (Jespersen 1924; Abney 1987 a.o.). Yet, some categories, such as prepositions, are known to be hybrid. To capture the in-between status of prepositions Zwarts (1997) proposed that the functional-lexical divide is structured by means of three independent privative parameters, viz. [+/-lexical], [+/-functional] and [+/-categorial]. In this article I adapt and develop this proposal to demonstrate that derivational affixes are a hybrid category as well. More specifically, I show that derivational affixes have lexical meaning and that they are an open class, which defines them as [+lexical]. Yet, they obligatorily select a complement, which makes them [+functional]. They may or may not determine the category of their functional superstructure, which renders them [+/-categorial]. It is thus argued that derivational affixes are not purely functional or lexical, just like prepositions. Yet, within the lexical-functional divide these two hybrid categories occupy different spaces.",0
"The ""root-and-pattern"" makeup of Semitic verbs has posed a long-standing puzzle for morphologists: the interpretation of a given root in a given template is difficult to predict, so the correlation between the morphophonological form (the template) and the syntax/semantics of the verb (its argument structure) is not transparent. As a result, it is unclear what the structure of the verb actually is and how the phonology and semantics interact. This paper addresses these questions by probing argument structure alternations in Hebrew.

I suggest a syntactic treatment of Hebrew in which verbal templates are the spell-out of functional heads familiar from contemporary syntactic technology. The mapping from phonology to semantics will be more transparent as a consequence.

The paper motivates a distinction between the heads Voice and v and proposes an ontology of these heads: different Voice heads manipulate the introduction of elements in the syntax, and different v heads manipulate the kind of event that is introduced. I argue that when these functional elements carry certain features they are overt in Hebrew, spelled out cyclically and giving rise to the different templates.",0
"This handbook article overviews two distinct senses of the term ""incorporation"". The first refers to a word-formation process akin to compounding, and is typically applied to the particular noun-verb compounding process known as ""noun incorporation"". The second refers to a syntactic approach to word-formation innovated by Mark C. Baker, head-movement, which was proposed to account for noun incorporation and other verb derivations such as causatives and applicatives. Competing theoretical approaches to noun incorporation are discussed and evaluated, and then the application of Baker's incorporation approach to other derivational contexts, especially deadjectival and denominal verbs, is discussed and assessed.",0
"Previous researchers have noted that verbal suppletion for ergative number agreement (i.e., agreement with the subjects of intransitives and the objects of transitives) is widespread throughout the Uto-Aztecan family, but none have systematically surveyed attested forms of suppletion nor posited proposals for reconstructions of suppletive morphs back to Proto-Uto-Aztecan. We redress this lacuna and argue for specific PUA reconstructions for two verbal domains: DIE and KILL. PUA had three distinct suppletive verb stems for these functions: *muku DIE.SG, *ko(i) DIE.PL, and *mɨɁa KILL.SG. PUA KILL.PL was derived by suffixing causative *-ya to the plural stem for DIE, thus *ko-ya. Other semantic functions are widespread enough to be reconstructable, but variation in attested morphs makes reconstructing forms difficult because of a lexical replacement process endemic to cases of strong suppletion: incursion (Juge 2000). We also find limited but suggestive evidence for possible areal contact effects involving diffusion of verbal suppletion patterns. In addition to contributing to scholarship on the diachrony and typology of verbal suppletion, our survey of UA languages also extensively documents suppletion in verbs that seems to be relatively ""lexical"". The empirical evidence from these languages thus runs counter to claims from recent literature within theoretical morphology which holds that suppletion must be limited to ""functional"" vocabulary items.",0
"Bound variable anaphora (BVA) is the term given to contexts where a pronominal anaphor functions like a logical variable in that its interpretation co-varies with the value assigned to its antecedent in a given universe of discourse. For example, in a math class with four girls (Alice, Beth, Carol, and Diane) the interpretation of the pronoun 'she' in the English sentence 'Every girl in math hopes that she will be an astronaut' varies according to which girl is picked out. For such a sentence to be evaluated as true it must be the case that each substitution of the pronoun for a constant yields a true proposition:  Alice hopes that Alice will be an astronaut, Beth hopes that Beth will be an astronaut, and so on.  Such sentences are often rendered by logical formulas such as [∀x, girl-in-math(x), x hopes that x will be an astronaut]. The study of BVA has figured prominently in modern studies of grammar, and has proven to be an important testing ground for formal theories of syntax and semantics. Here, we focus on the syntax of BVA.

After establishing that the necessary and sufficient conditions for BVA represent a convergence of semantic and syntactic properties (§1), we examine the distribution of bound variables in A-binding and A'-binding contexts (§2). We then turn to the question of the form of (A-bound and A'-bound) BVAs (§3), focusing on whether they can surface as reflexives, (overt or covert) pronouns, copy anaphors, unspecified binding expressions (UBEs), or indexicals. After considering whether the internal syntax of bound variables is uniform (§4), we attend to their semantic type (§5). We concude with a retrospective assessment of how analyses of BVA have developed over time, and speculate about future prospects (§6).",1
"The so-called ergativity split between perfect and progressive tenses is observed both in languages with a specialized ergative case (Punjabi) and in languages without (Kurdish). We propose that perfects are states/results corresponding to a VP projection; external arguments are introduced by means of an oblique case, namely an elementary functional head/predicate Q(⊆) ('oblique') or Loc(⊆) ('ergative') saying that the event is 'included by', 'located at' the argument. In a VP predicate the inflection picks up the internal argument, determining phi-feature identity ('agreement') with DPs lexicalizing it. Progressives have a more complex organization of the predicate/event, where the progressive head Asp projects a functional layer and can introduce the external argument, determining nominative type agreement. Punjabi further presents a canonical 1/2P vs. 3P Person split. Our proposal yields the syntactic Person split as a result of the intrinsic ability of 1/2P to serve as 'location-of-event'.",0
"Indefinites are felicitous with a reading where, internally to a contextually relevant set, the particular choice of referent is irrelevant. When a magician says 'Pick a card', context favors an interpretation where any card from the set would be a felicitous choice, as long as it is a card from the proposed set, as illustrated for modern Breton (Continental Celtic) in (1)a. Some indefinite constructions have this free-choice reading as the only felicitous one. This paper closely investigates such a free choice indefinite (FCI) that presents a typologically unusual morphology as illustrated in (1)b. 
 This free-choice indefinite is realized by reduplication of the head noun around what seems like a spatial proximate deictic morpheme (-mañ-). The relevant contrast with the regular indefinite 'ur gartenn' in (1)a is loss of optionality for the free-choice reading. The sentence in (1)a is felicitous if the magician proposes only one card,  whereas (1)b is not.
 
 (1)	DURING A SHOW, THE MAGICIAN SAYS:
    a. Trapit ur gartenn		   
       Pick    a   card       			                   
       'Pick a card.'				
     b. Trapit kartenn-mañ-kartenn. 
        pick    card-here-card 
       'Pick a card, any card.'		Breton
 
 In this paper, I will first investigate the DP-internal syntax and morphology of the reduplication construction in (1)b. I will propose that it results from the creation of a complex head noun by reduplication in a morphological step operated between syntax and phonological form. Next, I investigate the distribution of the Breton reduplicated FCI. I show that when preceded by a specificity marker, this construction behaves like a regular indefinite. When not preceded by this specificity marker, the noun exhibits the typical distributional restrictions of dependent indefinites. I will show that the bare use has existential quantificational force, but can acquire universal force when bound by a universal quantifier.",0
"We respond here to Kiparsky's 'Thoughts on Arregi & Nevins 2012' (Kiparsky 2013), an Optimality-Theoretic Lexicalist Morphology (LM) reanalysis of the Basque auxiliary systems that were characterized within a Distributed Morphology (DM) analysis in our book 'Morphotactics'. The two arguably most far-reaching goals/arguments of Kiparsky's paper are (i) to show that there are no opaque interactions in Basque (contrary to our claims in the book) (ii) that the Morphotactics version of DM fails to characterize wordhood. We respond to both of these claims. We observe, more generally, that a common argument against DM is that it is redundant to have a syntax and a postsyntax which partially overlap but are distinct modules. However, when one holds the LM analysis up to the light, it necessarily contains a syntax and a presyntax. As such, progress in the field will arguably come not from a comparison of which framework has 'fewer', partially overlapping modules - as both in fact have two - but which specific set of generalizations and proposals lead to a better understanding of the nature and limits of the constraints and repairs that characterize these closely related dialects.",0
"This paper presents a derivational OT account of the word-final deletion and augmentation alternations in Lardil. It presents two arguments in favor of the stratal view of derivations where the grammar is different at different stages (Bermúdez-Otero forthcoming, Kiparsky forthcoming), and against the serial view where the ranking is the same at all steps, and each step constitutes a minimal change (McCarthy 2006, 2007 et seq.). First, Lardil consonant deletion and vowel deletion cannot both be harmonically improving with respect to the same OT ranking (Kavitskaya and Staroverov 2010, McCarthy 2006). Second, the patterns of minimal word augmentation require some amount of derivational lookahead in a theory where each derivational step may only involve a minimal change.",0
"This paper reports a new case study of the research program initiated by Vance (1979), which is experimental investigations of rendaku. Rendaku is voicing of initial consonants of second members of compounds (e.g. /tako/ 'octopus' → /oo-dako/ 'big octopus'). Recent experiments identified a hitherto unnoticed factor that inhibits rendaku: when rendaku results in adjacent identical CV moras, rendaku applicability is reduced (e.g., */iga+gamoke/ from /iga/+/kamoke/). However, these previous studies have only tested the Identity Avoidance effect at the moraic level. 


The current study tests whether Identity Avoidance at the consonantal level, which is more familiar from restrictions found in many Semitic languages, also affects the applicability of rendaku. The current study shows that, although its effect is weaker than the moraic Identity Avoidance, speakers avoid identical consonants in adjacent syllables (e.g. */iga+gomoke/ from /iga/+/komoke/). The current study overall offers the following new understanding about Japanese phonology and general phonological theory: (i) renkdau is subject to the consonantal Identity Avoidance effect, which is a new descriptive discovery (ii) a restriction that is operative at Semitic languages is also operative in Japanese, revealing an intriguing cross-linguistic parallel (iii) Identity Avoidance at different phonological levels coexist within a single language, and (iv) the strength of the avoidance effect correlates with the degree of similarity. Finally, although rendaku has a long research tradition, these effects of Identity Avoidance were not known. The current findings therefore highlight the importance of experimentation in phonological research.",1
"Many morphologically ergative languages display asymmetries in the extraction of core arguments: while absolutive arguments (transitive objects and intransitive subjects) extract freely, ergative arguments(transitive subjects) cannot. This falls under the label ""syntactic ergativity"" (see e.g. Dixon 1972, 1994, Manning 1996). Extraction asymmetries are found in many languages of the Mayan family, where in order to extract transitive subjects (for focus, question, or relativization), a special construction known as the ""Agent Focus"" (AF) must be used. These AF constructions have been described as syntactically transitive and semantically dyadic, because they contain two non-oblique DP arguments, but morphologically intransitive because the verb appears with only a single agreement marker and takes an intransitive status suffix (Aissen 1999, Stiebels 2006). In this paper we offer a proposal for (i) why some morphologically ergative languages exhibit extraction asymmetries, while others do not; and (ii) how the Mayan AF construction circumvents this problem. We adopt recent accounts which argue that ergative languages vary in the locus of absolutive case assignment (Aldridge 2004, 2008a, Legate 2002, 2008), and propose that this variation is present within the Mayan family. Based primarily on comparative data from Q'anjob'al and Chol, we argue that the inability to extract ergative arguments does not reflect a problem with properties of the ergative subject, but rather reflects locality properties of absolutive case assignment in the clause. We show how the AF morpheme -on circumvents this problem in Q'anjob'al by assigning case to internal arguments.",0
"This dissertation proposes the Splitting theory of consonant epenthesis, which incorporates two key ideas: (1) there is a phonological operation called 'splitting', where an input segment corresponds to multiple output segments, and (2) there is no insertion operation involving consonants.

Within Splitting theory, epenthetic consonants always correspond to an input segment, and the mapping is always regulated by constraints requiring input-output identity. From this perspective, homorganic glide epenthesis next to high vowels is the most faithful epenthesis possible. For example, in the mapping /i/→[ji], input /i/ corresponds to both [j] and [i] in the output, and both output segments preserve all input features.

Splitting theory predicts that epenthetic consonants will be as faithful to their input vowel correspondent as possible. However, in some cases perfect faithfulness is not achievable. For example, there is no featurally identical glide counterpart of non-high vowels. Consequently, next to non-high vowels there are several options for epenthetic consonants, all of which preserve some of the input's features.

If the most faithful option is banned from a surface inventory, the epenthetic consonant has to be unfaithful to its input correspondent. In these cases, the quality of inserted consonants is also affected by the ranking of faithfulness constraints. An extreme case is found in Mongolian, where a dorsal/uvular stop is epenthesized in vowel hiatus because there is no other consonant that would preserve the place of articulation, voicing, and non-nasality of underlying vowels.

Splitting theory's emphasis on faithfulness differs from theories where the epenthetic segment does not correspond to any input segment. For example, such theories predict that epenthetic [t] is possible, while Splitting theory imposes very restrictive (and practically insurmountable) conditions on any system having epenthetic [t]. Putative cases of epenthetic [t] are shown to admit alternative analyses (e.g. Ajyíninka Apurucayali).

Splitting Theory is supported by an in-depth survey of the inventory of epenthetic consonants. The theory is illustrated by analyses of consonant epenthesis in Dutch, English, Faroese, Madurese, Mongolian, and Washo.",0
"In this paper I question the widely accepted idea that nominal possessors are analogous to
subjects of transitive verbs (""external subjects""). This idea is founded upon the existence of
languages whose morphology marks nominal possessors and subjects of transitive verbs alike
(Abney, 1987). Here I introduce languages whose morphology marks nominal possessors and
subjects of intransitive verbs alike. Unlike subjects of transitive verbs, subjects of intransitive
verbs can be generated in a variety of structural positions (Hale and Keyser, 1993). This fact
creates difficulties for the determination of the structure of possessed noun phrases.",0
"We analyze three types of cases in which exceptional morphemes become regular in the presence of other morphemes (regularization effects). Vowel deletion in some Russian prepositions depends on the root that follows the preposition and also on the suffix that follows the root. In Japanese, dominant suffixes assign an accentual pattern to accented roots, but in Slovenian, dominance is conditional--revoked by another suffix. Finally, Tagalog and Dutch loanwords can contain non-native segments, except when certain affixes are present. We account for these phenomena in a new constraint-based framework, Lexical MaxEnt with regularization factors. In this framework, constraint weights are rescaled for exceptional morphemes, and some affixes carry regularization factors that reduce or cancel rescaling. We argue that regularization is a property of morphemes rather than whole words, and that it follows from how these morphemes are combined in the grammar rather than from whole-word storage in the lexicon.",1
"This thesis is concerned with sluicing, the ellipsis of TP in a Wh-question leaving a Wh-phrase ""remnant"" overt. Sluicing is subject to an identity condition that must hold between the sluiced question and its antecedent. There is currently no consensus on whether this condition should be characterized as syntactic or semantic in nature, or whether a hybrid condition that makes reference to both semantic and syntactic identity is needed (Merchant 2005, Chung 2013, Barker 2013).

I provide a new identity condition that captures extant syntactic generalizations while allowing for enough wiggle room to let in detectible mismatches between the antecedent and sluice. The identity condition I propose is ""split"" between two sub-conditions, one that pertains to the relationship between the sluiced Wh-phrase and its correlate in the antecedent (the Remnant Condition), and one that pertains to the sluiced question as a whole (the Sluice Condition). The Split Identity hypothesis counts as a hybrid identity condition. The Remnant Condition is novel, and requires that the remnant have a syntactic correlate in the antecedent with which it matches semantically. Split Identity is shown to capture the data motivating extant syntactic generalizations. The Sluice Condition requires that the sluiced question and the Question under Discussion (QuD) that the antecedent makes salient seek the same answers, and is an implementation of QuD-based approaches to the semantic condition on sluicing (Ginzburg and Sag 2000, AnderBois 2011).

The Split identity condition also lets in ""pseudosluices"" alongside isomorphic sluices, where the sluiced question is a cleft or a copular question while the antecedent is not. Pseudosluicing has often been proposed as a last resort mechanism, only available when an isomorphic structure is independently ruled out (Rodrigues et al. 2009, Vicente 2008, van Craenenbroeck 2010). I defend a view where pseudosluicing is not a special case of sluicing, so that the identity condition should not distinguish between copular and non-copular clauses in the evaluation of identity. Split Identity achieves this in making no reference to the syntactic content of the ellipsis site.",0

"While it has been recognized in the semantics literature that gender features may be valued either from the syntactic structure, or from the context (Heim, 2008; Spathas, 2010; Sudo, 2012, among others), the consequences of the two sources of valuation for establishing φ-feature Agree chains have not been suffi- ciently explored. This paper attempts to remedy the situation by presenting a case study of Italian nominal inflection that directly bears on this question. The Stan- dard Italian nominal system morphologically marks two distinct genders, three distinct nominal classes (idiosyncratic nominal endings), and two numbers, a combination which lends itself to a theoretical investigation of number-gender in- teractions. Crucially, Italian nominal inflection also distinguishes between gram- matical, i.e., idiosyncratic, and natural, i.e., context-dependent, gender. This paper provides evidence that even though the source of valuation of these two genders is distinct, their grammatical locus is the same. More precisely, they enter the same gender Agree chain. The main theoretical contribution of the paper comes from configurations in which there are two possible sources of valuation of the same gender Agree chain. This in turn allows us to investigate the timing of related syntactic operations and their interactions in a controlled way.
I use the intricate patterns to argue that we need to distinguish between val- uation by Agree, i.e., a narrow-syntax process that utilizes Feature Inheritance (Richards, 2007; Chomsky, 2008, and subsequent work) and Agree, and variable binding, i.e, a process that gets triggered by labeling modeled as minimal search (Chomsky, 2013). While in most cases the output of these two processes is iden- tical, I present data from the domain of socio-linguistic variation where we can observe a reflex of the distinction in the overt morphology.
More precisely, the data provide evidence that unvalued φ-features within DP are always introduced by D. If φ-features appear on lower functional heads, it is only via Feature Inheritance. Their value, however, may be assigned either by an assignment function introduced by D, triggered by labeling at the Transfer to the interpretive component, or it may be encoded in the lexical entry of a nominal root (cf. Kramer 2009).1
The option of having features valued from two different places, combined with Feature Inheritance, yields non-trivial timing interactions, including interactions that are best modeled in terms of φ-feature Agree intervention. The crucial obser- vation is that only properly individuating D introduces a complete set of gender and number features. Consequently, gender assignment is dependent on the di- visional function in the sense of Borer (2005), and not on the counter function, related to the Number feature.
The second major contribution of the paper is that it provides evidence that there is no gender and number dependency as such (cf. Greenberg 1963; Noyer 1992; Harley and Ritter 2002, among others). Instead, the paper argues that the seeming gender-number dependency is a side effect of gender valuation being de- pendent on the (non-)deficiency of the divisional head. The empirical motivation for the proposal comes from the domain of mass nouns and nominals denoting predicative or non-atomic relations; namely, from the observation that Ds refer- ring to non-atomic entities give rise to defective gender and number chains in a way parallel to defective T in the CP domain.
Aside from providing a theoretical motivation for distinguishing between val- uation by Agree and variable binding, and a theoretical explanation for the cross- linguistically common dependency between number and gender, the paper makes one additional theoretical contribution. Namely, that only a subset of nouns are based on category-neutral roots (cf. Marantz 1997), a conclusion supported by data from derivational morphology and compounding.",1
This is a handbook article which provides an overview of some of the empirical and theoretical issues surrounding ergativity in relation to parametric theory.,0
"In this thesis, I propose the hypothesis that ergative Case in certain languages may be assigned to a DP which would be otherwise Case-less within a certain domain. In this sense, ergative Case appears to be a default. At the same time, I argue that ergative Case may be assigned by any phase head to the highest Case-less DP within its Spell-Out domain (= henceforth phase head Case) – it is not just a default. This gives rise to the impression that assignment of ergative Case is a default, though it is in fact structurally determined.

One of the crucial consequences of this approach is that ergative Case can be aligned with grammatical relations more flexibly than in previous approaches. Ergative may look like an 'alignment' because in the majority of sentences the subject in a transitive sentence is aligned with ergative Case. I argue that appearances are deceiving, and that if we look carefully at the full range of instances in which ergative is found, a different generalization emerges. I demonstrate that what is called ergative may constitute phase head Case in certain languages. There is no a priori reason to posit a correlation between ergative Case and grammatical relations – a DP receiving ergative Case could be either subject or object.

In this thesis, I investigate (split) ergativity in Mayan languages (mainly Kaqchikel, Chol, Q'anjob'al and Ixil) as a testing ground for the plausibility of the hypothesis that phase head Case exists, and is the correct analysis of certain phenomena generally analyzed as instances of ergative alignment. I also explore possible avenues in which we can expand the scope of our analysis. For this purpose, I discuss languages outside Mayan (i.e., Chukchee, Tagalog and Kurmanji) with an eye towards the extension of the default ergative analysis to these languages. I focus on the cross-linguistically attested syncretism between ergative and oblique case, and suggest that ergative may also be assigned to an otherwise Case-less DP in these languages in parallel with Mayan languages.",0
"This dissertation is a contribution to an on-going debate on whether information structure has direct access to syntax, or not since Rizzi's (1997) seminal paper 'The Fine Structure of the Left Periphery'. I provide arguments from Basàá, a noun class, focus-drop, topic-drop and tone language from the Bantu language family spoken in Cameroon, that scope-discourse properties such as focus, topic, interrogation, evidentiality and the like are grammatical primitives which take part in the syntactic derivation. In line with the current cartographic approach to syntactic structures, it is shown that Basàá, like many other natural languages, is inclined to using overt morphemes when expressing scope-discourse properties. Of interest is the fact that focus, topic, interrogative as well as evidential markers are realized only in ex-situ contexts and never in-stu. It is demonstrated that just like Basàá expresses the I(inflection)-related information such as tense and aspect overtly, so does it with information structure-related categories. Focus, topic, interrogation and evidentiality should be considered as formal features just like other formal features. In order to achieve the goal of this work, the analysis is based on Rizzi's (1997 and subsequent works) split-CP hypothesis. It is showed that the Basàá left edge is a prolific and articulated domain due to a proliferation of different functional categories which 'populate' (Rizzi 2013) the complementizer domain of the language. Focus fronting, topic fronting, evidentiality as well as interrogation are expressed in the left periphery via the use of distinct and specific morphemes which signal the presence of each scope-discourse property in the sentence. One salient characteristic of this language is that it exhibits rich agreement morphology. Such a property enriches its complementizer layer so much so that fronted foci, fronted topics and evidential constituents trigger not only morphological marking related to each discourse property, but they also trigger overt agreement morphology. In addition to the clausal left periphery, there exists in the language a low focus projection in the vicinity of the VP. Due to minimality effects, this focus position attracts only wh-items and never focalized non-wh constituents. It seems to be the case that the Basàá empirical material enriches not only theoretical syntax, but also comparative syntax in terms of ellipsis, a domain of linguistic theory which, probably, has not yet been (significantly) explored in the context of African linguistics at large and Bantu linguistics in particular. The study of sluicing and fragment answers is well accounted for under a restrictive theory of phonology-morphology-syntax and semantics interfaces and the division of labour between these interfaces. Such a theory does justice to the ellipsis approach according to which these constructions involve PF-deletion of the propositions out of which extraction has been applied prior to A-bar movement of the sluiced or the fragment. Thus, the major contribution of Basàá is that the E-feature which is responsible for ellipsis and which has been said to be covertly realized in English-like languages can be sometimes realized overtly in Basaá. This state of affairs confirms the claim that Basàá is a mixed language i.e. it is in-between languages with overt formal features and those with covert features. Overall, failure to include scope discourse categories in core syntax would violate the Inclusiveness Condition (Chomsky 1995; Aboh 2010) and would lead to a purely impoverished traditional syntax which requires that syntactic structures be confined to the sole classical C-I-V architecture as defended by Minimalist syntax, and as opposed to cartography which militates in favour of a detailed, articulated and precise study of syntactic atoms in terms of content, number, hierarchical order and function. 
Globally, the study proposes a novel framework for the derivation of focus and topic fronting in Basàá. More precisely, it is proposed that focus and topic (except hanging and frame setting topics) fronting involve a bi-clausal non-cleft structure which requires that focalized/topicalized elements get moved into the embedded FocP/TopP first, prior to moving into the matrix TP position for the purpose of the EPP. While the first movement step is said to be motivated scope-discourse requirements, namely focus and topic, the second one is motivated by the EPP i.e. the requirement that the matrix TP should have a subject. This second movement operation is attributed to the unavailability in the language of expletive/dummy subjects that would otherwise satisfy the EPP in the matrix TP. Fragment answers, by virtue of being considered as fronted foci are also derived using the same mechanism except in a very rare case while sluicing is said to be derived by wh-movement of the sluiced into Spec-EvidP or Spec-Wh-P, depending on the nature of the wh-item. Whereas the target of ellipsis in fragment answers is a functional FocP projection in almost all cases, what deletes in the context of sluicing is an AgrSP projection. The idea that focus and topic fronting are not cleft constructions pertains to their semantic interpretation. Focus fronting is not necessarily associated with exhaustive or contrastive interpretation in light or their morphosyntax, semantics and pragmatics. Exhaustivity and contrastiveness can be attested only in specific discourse contexts. The semantic interpretation of  topics never allows them to be exhaustive and their contrastive interpretation is not that of exclusion as expected from bona fide clefts.
The Basaá clausal left periphery is a prolific, composite, complex and articulated layer which is made up of four main sub-domains as briefly depicted in the following snapshot:
{Domain A[fixed word order] ForceP  >  IntP  >  }{Domain B[flexible word order] TopP[Scene setting]  > TopP[Hanging] > Wh-P}{Domain C[flexible word order] TopP[Aboutness/Contrastive] > TopP[Additive] }{Domain D[fixed word order] EvidP > FocP  >}[AgrS-P/TP…",0
"Like many Algonquian languages, Mi'gmaq has multiple verbal affixes which index the phi(φ)-features (person, number, gender) of arguments. One possibility is that verbal affixes are instances of agreement, a relationship (AGREE) between a functional head (probe) and a DP argument (goal) resulting in the functional head displaying the φ-features of the goal (Chomsky, 2000). Another possibility is that verbal affixes are clitics, a D-like pronoun which is a copy of the φ-features of a DP argument and attaches to a functional projection (Preminger, 2009). In this paper I show that Mi'gmaq has both agreement affixes (theme signs and inner suffixes) and clitics (outer suffixes). The presence of multiple agreement affixes is important as it supports the presence of φ-feature agreement in the thematic domain (Oxford, 2013), as opposed to agreement being solely limited to the inflectional domain (Woolford, 2010; Nevins, 2011). I conclude that theme signs and inner suffixes are instances of φ agreement on Voice and T, respectively. However, these cannot simply be classified as object and subject agreement, as multiple arguments can, and often must, be probed in order to account for the conditioning of agreement affixes. I find evidence to support two different notions of multiple argument probing, Cyclic Agree (Béjar and Rezac, 2009) and Multiple Agree (Nevins, 2011), which are not mutually exclusive, but represent the specific nature of AGREE on Voice and T, respectively.",0
"This paper examines the synchronic status of laryngeal consonants (glottal stop and h) in Guarijío, a Uto-Aztecan language of Chihuahua and Sonora, Mexico. I focus on their word-internal distribution in roots and affixes and their behavior under reduplication, showing that both have a very limited distribution and arguing that a different analysis is appropriate for each. I argue that /h/ is a consonantal phoneme (as is usually assumed), and claim that its deletion from the coda of the base under reduplication may be a consequence of backcopying to match its codaless reduplicant. Such would be consistent with other backcopying-like reduplicative morphology in the language, such as templatic backcopying to a syllable in the ""abbreviated"" class of reduplication (Caballero 2006). Glottal stops, on the other hand, are limited to following the first vowel in all contexts. I make the novel claim that these consonants appear as floating root features rather than underlying consonants, following Macaulay and Salmons' (1995) proposal for similar facts in Mixtec. Guarijío laryngeals provide important sources of evidence for different aspects of comparative Uto-Aztecan historical phonology, so these synchronic analyses help form a firmer basis for future work in historical reconstruction.",0

"The Quantification of Nominal phrases in Slavic is one of the most analyzed but also still a poor understood and controversial point of discussion in both traditional descriptive and generative studies. Numeral phrases in Polish and Russian, as in other West and East Slavic languages, exhibit puzzling behavior. In particular, to judge by the morphosyntax of the constituents of the numeral phrase, the internal structure of the phrase appears to depend upon the external context of that phrase. The problem is a well-known paradox of Slavic syntax, and a considerable literature has been devoted to it. The purpose of this paper, which complements other work by Babby (1987), Franks (1995), Kosta (2008), Rappaport (2002), (2003) and Rutkowski (2006), is to develop a Minimalist theory of formal features, case syncretism, and lexical representation which effectively removes the paradox by maintaining (despite appearances) the usual independence of internal phrase structure and external context, while placing the morphosyntactic variation where such anomalous facts belong: in the lexicon and to the interfaces.
In the first part, I shall try to give a short overview of the puzzle concerning all the problems of case, number assignment and agreement in numeral and numerative constructions in Russian and Polish. In the second part, I shall try to give the solution to some problems so far unresolved, namely in which connection Agreement and Case assignment are driven by interface conditions of either PF (SM) or LF (CI) in the new approach of Strong Minimalist Thesis (Chomsky 2005). The patterns of Case assignment will be analyzed under the notion Agree and Feature checking within the descriptive generalization of so called heterogeneous vs. homogeneous paradigm. This section tries to refine the analysis of ""heterogeneous"" vs. ""homogenous"" morphosyntax of numeral expressions making use of recent syntactic developments, namely the emergence of the case-assigning mechanism Agree. The key insight is taken from Gilbert Rappaport's approach on case assignment (2002), refined and enriched by the mechanism of interpretability and valuation of features from the recent studies on the Syntax of Valuation and the interpretability of Features developed by David Pesetsky and Esther Torrego (2004).",0
"I discuss three properties of Brazilian Pomeranian, a Germanic language spoken in Espirito Santo, Brazil by descendents who emigrated in the 19th century. These three aspects of the verbal system are: 1. The relation between complex complementizers, a two-infinitive system, and split infinitives, previously discussed in Van Gelderen (1993, 1998) and Schallert (2012, 2013), 2. Verb Projection Raising (VPR), as discussed by Van Riemsdijk 2002, Haegeman 2007, Salzmann 2011, and Brandner & Salzmann 2012, and 3. Verb-Second positioning of verbal clusters, previously discussed in De Vos (2005). I discuss novel Pomeranian data from the perspective of the literature on these three topics, which have been thus far studied largely separately from one another. An integrated discussion sheds light on the nature and the proper analysis of these three phenomena. I argue that these phenomena are caused by the ""weaknesses"" of T. The weakness of T can be resolved ""downward"" by copying features onto T under selection by a higher head (AGREE), or can be resolved ""upward"" under head movement of T.",0
"Loanwords often exhibit non-native structures. Some of these structures are replaced by the corresponding native ones only in morphologically integrated loanwords, both diachronically and synchronically. This paper provides empirical evidence that the foreign structures may differ in what kind of morphologically complex words they appear.

These typological distinctions are attributed to a single class of OT constraints.",0

"This paper seeks to give a syntactic analysis of Old Hungarian verbal gerunds. I take the `mixed projection' approach to nominalizations (Bresnan 1997, Borsley and Kornfilt 2000, Alexiadou 2001, a.o.), whereby the extended vP is embedded under nominal functional categories. I argue that in the verbal part of the gerund there is solid evidence for AspP/PredP dominating VoiceP, but there is no conclusive evidence for a TP being projected. I suggest that the object of the gerundival verb may undergo scrambling to a position above negation, while the subject becomes a derived possessor on the surface. I propose that these gerunds do not contain a nominalizer (see Alexiadou 2005, Alexiadou et al. 2010b; 2011 for this possibility); the extended vP is embedded directly under the nominal functional head Poss.",0

"Adjectives like 'brown-eyed' seem to have a participial ending (which we argue is not a past or passive marker), and show a number of restrictions, such as obligatory modification (*eyed, *legged), even when these would be potentially informative (*the snake is legged, *John is not legged). We propose an analysis in terms of inalienable possession, situated within the typology of variation in inalienability, in which these adjectives are formed and evaluated within a closed domain, that, very much like idiomatic expressions, excludes the subject noun phrase and negation, thereby unifying the properties of this 'word-level' construction with independently-found restrictions on demonstrably syntactic phrases.",1

"The current experiment investigates the psychological reality of Rosen's Rule and Strong Lyman's Law. Rosen's Rule predicts, in part, that rendaku is more likely to occur when N1 has three moras than when it has two moras. Strong Lyman's Law predicts that rendaku is less likely when N1 contains a voiced obstruent. Our wug-test shows neither of these predictions to be borne out. Although the null results must be interpreted with caution, by comparing the current results with those from previous experimental studies on rendaku, we conclude that the effects of these two factors are not substantial, and that they are not synchronically active in the minds of Japanese speakers, at least not for the Japanese community as a whole.",0
"In this thesis I explore opaque interactions of Merge and Agree in order to gain insights into the nature of elementary operations and their mode of application (simultaneous vs. sequential, extrinsic vs. intrinsic ordering). I investigate a configuration in which the Cycle does not predict an order among operations, i.e. in which a single head triggers both Merge and Agree. I argue (i) for more fine-grained elementary operations, in particular for a distinction between different types of Merge because they can apply at different stages of the derivation relative to Agree, and (ii) for extrinsic ordering of the operation-inducing features on a head. I investigate the  configuration in which a single head triggers more than one operation because the Cycle is too weak to make any predictions about the order of operations. The effect in (i) becomes visible when Merge is interleaved with Agree: Empirical evidence suggests that Merge can apply both before and after Agree within a single language because it can feed / bleed Agree and also counter-feed / -bleed Agree: Merge > Agree > Merge. This symmetric order cannot be derived if, as assumed in recent literature in transparent interactions, there is a language-specific parameter that simply orders Merge relative to Agree.  Based on the order where Agree ""splits up"" the Merge operation I show that we need to distinguish between final and intermediate movement steps (two types of internal Merge), external vs. internal Merge, and movement type-specific final and intermediate movement steps. The first distinction is motivated for interactions of Merge with upward and downward Agree. The empirical basis are reflexes of movement, which I take to be the result of a feeding interaction of Agree and internal Merge. I identify four patterns of reflexes  and argue that variation is best analysed as a consequence of reordering of operations on a head: Movement steps that apply before Agree can feed or bleed Agree; those that apply after Agree have the opposite effect, i.e. they counter-feed/-bleed Agree. The ordering approach presents the first uniform analysis of these patterns; in addition, it can  account for multiple reflexes and optionality of reflexes. I argue against alternative enriched representations analyses of opacity for empirical and conceptual reasons (incompatibility with Minimalist assumptions and modern theories of movement). Given that the approach crucially relies on timing (only a single operation can apply at any given stage of the derivation), it provides strong evidence for a strictly derivational model of grammar. In addition, I argue on the basis of the cross-linguistic variation that (i) final and intermediate movement steps in a long movement dependency are triggered by different features, (ii) that long movement always applies successive-cyclically even if we do not see a reflex of movement in all intermediate landing sites, (iii) that Agree applies in the syntax and is not a post-syntactic operation, and (iv) that the timing of edge feature discharge must be more flexible than proposed in the literature.",1
"In this paper we will analyze the causative-anticausative opposition from the point of view of semantic construal, and how syntax builds structures that convey that information with minimal entropy. We will also analyze the tension that arises when a putatively universal semantic construal, (narrow-)syntactically instatiated, is to be materialized using limited, language-specific resources. This will touch on the subject of language typology, and its importance to describe the observable effects of this tension between semantics and morpho-phonology, from a GEN(eration)-EVAL(uation) approach, a common feature in Optimality Theoretical syntax. Consequences for comparative linguistics will be suggested, with particular emphasis on Slavic, Germanic, and Romance languages.",0
"How human language arose is a mystery in the evolution of Homo sapiens. Miyagawa et al. (2013) put forward a proposal, which we will call the Integration Hypothesis of human language evolution, that holds that human language is composed of two components, E for expressive, and L for lexical. Each component has an antecedent in nature: E as found, for example, in birdsong, and L in, for example, the alarm calls of monkeys. E and L integrated uniquely in humans to give rise to language. A challenge to the Integration Hypothesis is that while these non-human systems are finite-state in nature, human language is known to require characterization by a non-finite state grammar. Our claim is that E and L, taken separately, are in fact finite-state; when a grammatical process crosses the boundary between E and L, it gives rise to the non-finite state character of human language. We provide empirical evidence for the Integration Hypothesis by showing that certain processes found in contemporary languages that have been characterized as non-finite state in nature can in fact be shown to be finite-state. We also speculate on how human language actually arose in evolution through the lens of the Integration Hypothesis.",1

"This paper is a review article about the pioneering work of G. David McNeill and various others on the interaction of gestures with human language and their vital role in the evolution of human language. McNeill argues, for example, that language and gesture must have begun together, that neither could have preceded the other. He also makes the case that the gesture-syntax connection was the most important step in language evolution and that compositionality and recursion played lesser, secondary (though extremely important) roles. I argue that McNeill's work is compatible with various papers and books of my own, especially Everett (2012). I further argue that McNeill's work supports the research program of ""embodied cogntion."" I argue that linguistic field researchers, theoreticians, and typologists ought not to work in a ""gesture vacuum.""",1
"In a number of Slavic and Germanic languages, various derivational affixes and morphological patterns of Latin origin are relatively common, and bear effects as abstract as deriving event nouns from verbs and property nouns from adjectives. This seems to contradict the general observation that abstract morphology typically is not subject to borrowing. We discuss the status of two Serbo-Croatian (S-C) nominalizing Latinate suffixes, -cija and -itet, which display relatively high values of productivity and frequency. On our analysis, these are not borrowed suffixes and derivational patterns, in the sense that they were present in another language and got copied into S-C, but rather suffixes and patterns which emerged within S-C, more specifically in the Latinate stratum of the S-C lexicon. In other words, we argue that members of these two classes of nominalizations were first borrowed as simplex words.  After demonstrating that the sequences -cija and -itet display quantitative patterns characteristic of the productive native suffixes, we argue that these quantitative effects, in conspiracy with the shared semantic properties of the nouns ending in these sequences, have led to a reanalysis of the initial simplex borrowed forms as derived nouns involving a stem and the suffix -cija or -itet, respectively. Pragmatic, phonotactic and prosodic constraints apply to these derivations to the effect that the suffixes that have emerged in the borrowed domain of the lexicon never enter a competition with the native nominalization patterns.",0
"Understanding the evolution of language requires evidence regarding origins and processes that led to change. In the last 40 years, there has been an explosion of research on this problem as well as a sense that considerable progress has been made. We argue instead that the richness of ideas is accompanied by a poverty of evidence, with essentially no explanation of how and why our linguistic computations and representations evolved. We show that, to date, (1) studies of nonhuman animals provide virtually no relevant parallels to human linguistic communication, and none to the underlying biological capacity; (2) the fossil and archaeological evidence does not inform our understanding of the computations and representations of our earliest ancestors, leaving details of origins and selective pressure unresolved; (3) our understanding of the genetics of language is so impoverished that there is little hope of connecting genes to linguistic processes any time soon; (4) all modeling attempts have made unfounded assumptions, and have provided no empirical tests, thus leaving any insights into language's origins unverifiable. Based on the current state of evidence, we submit that the most fundamental questions about the origins and evolution of our linguistic capacity remain as mysterious as ever, with considerable uncertainty about the discovery of either relevant or conclusive evidence that can adjudicate among the many open hypotheses. We conclude by presenting some suggestions about possible paths forward.",0
"The goal of this thesis is to argue, on theoretical and empirical grounds, that mechanisms in charge of language acquisition define both synchronic and diachronic patterns of linguistic realisation found across natural languages. This aim leads us to explore, then, how Greenberg's problem is derivative from Plato's problem. An approach to the logical problem of language acquisition in terms of a modified discovery procedure is proposed, which, based on learnability considerations, anchors the acquisition of abstract properties on perceptible ones. Within this enterprise, a learning constraint and a mechanism of data analysis, both instances of Third Factor principles, are argued to be at work in the growth of language in the individual. From the effects that the learning constraint and the mechanism of data analysis have on the resulting acquired I-languages, some patterns of synchronic and diachronic variation are derived.",0
"This dissertation, which is situated in broad debates over the delineation of abstract grammatical knowledge from the use of language in context, argues for distinct but interacting contributions from grammatical, psychological, and social factors in the production of intraspeaker linguistic variability. The phenomenon under investigation is the tendency of speakers to repeat recently-used linguistic options in conversational speech, which I refer to as persistence. I take up three major themes: the use of persistence as evidence on the mental-representational unity of variable linguistic processes; the interaction of different loci of variation with different cognitively-rooted facilitatory effects; and the contextual sensitivity of persistence to both social and grammatical expectations.

The core results of this dissertation are based on data from 122 interviews drawn from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus (Labov and Rosenfelder, 2011). I argue for distinct phonological and morphological processes in the production of the common morphophonological variables ING (working/workin'), TD (old/ol'), and DH (them/dem/'em), with morphological variation showing generalized persistence while phonological variation is persistent only under conditions of lexical repetition. Specifically, I propose that verbal and nominal ING constitute distinct variables, as do past tense and monomorphemic TD, and that the alternation between stop and continuant consonants in DH is morphological in nature. The quantitative decay profiles of these variables, I suggest, tie their phonological versus morphological loci to their representation in episodic versus abstract memory systems.

Although the driving force behind persistence, in this view, is the operation of various general cognitive processes, I further argue that these processes reflect speakers' sociolinguistic awareness in a way that supports a holistic expectation-based view of persistence asymmetries. The quantitative results and new questions in this dissertation set the stage for continued progress toward an integrated model of how social, grammatical, and psychological forces contribute to the production of linguistic variation.",0
"Previous works on Argument Ellipsis/AE (Oku 1998; Kim 1999; Şener and Takahashi 2010; Takahashi 2007, 2010, 2013a, b) point out that Japanese allows this option for null subjects and objects alike, unlike Chinese, which accepts this option only for null objects. Drawing on Saito's (2007) Anti-Agreement Hypothesis, Takahashi (2010, 2013a) proposes that this cross-linguistic difference follows from the assumption (Miyagawa 2010) that Chinese has person-agreement associated with the grammatical subject, unlike Japanese which lacks a phi-agreement system altogether (Fukui 1986; Kuroda 1988). Rejecting this agreement-based analysis on empirical and conceptual grounds, I propose instead that the subject-object asymmetry in Chinese follows from the well-known definite subject restriction, which, in turn, is derived from the topic-prominent profile of this language (Li and Thompson 1976, 1981). More generally, I argue that the [Top] feature in topic-prominent languages like Chinese and phi-agreement in subject-prominent languages like Italian, both inherited to T from the phase-defining head C (Chomsky 2007, 2008; Richards 2007), play essentially the same computational role in uniquely determining the content of a missing subject in [Spec, T] as a definite description/pro (Taraldsen 1979; Chomsky 1981). I further show that this non-parametric uniformity theory yields a new insight into the nature of the cross-linguistic, position-sensitive distribution of AE.",0
"We examine two types of deverbal nominalisations in Serbo-Croatian, both derived by the same suffix -VV.je (suffix -je which lengthens the final syllable of the stem it gets added to). One type is derived from imperfective verbs; it involves productive nominalizations with gerund semantics, and it is characterized by a prosodic pattern which is encountered elsewhere in the paradigm of the verb. The other is derived from perfective verbs; it involves idiosyncratic nominalisations, both in terms of the selection of verbs which can derive them, and in terms of the semantic interpretation, and they are characterized by a prosodic pattern that never fits any of the forms in the paradigm of the verb: high tone on the two final syllables, and penultimate stress.
We propose that the notion of paradigm should be defined as the domain of systematic productivity of a stem, under full semantic transparency. Our analysis of the facts observed is that members of the paradigm - in our case the imperfective nominalisations - are subject to Steriade's Lexical Conservatism, which presses them to use a prosodic pattern available within the paradigm. When the result of the morphological process (adding the suffix -VV.je to the stem) is a new stem with an own paradigm, the new stem is as a simplex without a tone (or stress) specification in the lexicon. While it has been shown that the post-lexical, i.e. default, prosodic pattern in S-C is that with the high tone on the initial syllable (Zec 1999, Simonović 2012), we argue that lexical items with a long penultimate syllable select for a different post-lexical default, namely the one with a rising span over the two final syllables.
We argue that this picture fits well into a more general view that the lexicon has the structure of a coconut: a soft core with productive elements deriving large paradigms connected by shared lexical prosodic shapes, a hard outer layer of extreme idiosyncratic items in respect of productivity, semantics and prosody, and a middle, semi-hardened layer of derived words exiled from the paradigms of their stems, with both semantics and prosody somewhere between the two extremes.",0
"This article develops an analysis of a pair of morphological alternations in K'ichee' (Mayan) that are conditioned at the right edge of intonational phrase boundaries. I propose a syntax-prosody mapping algorithm that derives intonational phrase boundaries from the surface syntax, and then argue that each alternation can be understood in terms of output optimization (Mascaró 2007; Mester 1994). The important fact is that K'ichee' requires a prominence peak rightmost in the intonational phrase, and so the morphological alternations occur in order to ensure an optimal host for this prominence peak. Finally, I consider the wider implications of the analysis for the architecture of the syntax-phonology interface, especially as it concerns late-insertion theories of morphology (Anderson 1982, 1992; Embick and Noyer 2001; Halle and Marantz 1993; Hayes 1990, among others). The primary result is that late lexical insertion must occur at least as late as the construction of intonational phrases.",0
"The aim of this paper is to analyse the Catalan and Spanish quotative recomplementation (QRC) in terms of pragmatic features encoded by morphosyntax. In QRC constructions, the second complementizer (que2) is used to set the boundaries between a reproduced discourse and the clausal elements that were implicit in the original discourse, which must be reintroduced in the new communicative situation because they are not shared by the interlocutor (e.g. Sp. Están sentados en la mesa --> Ha dicho que1 los invitados #(que2) están sentados en la mesa). QRC is an evidence for the existence of two types of complements for assertive verbs: quotative complements (embedded speech acts with a de dicto interpretation) and reportative complements (speech events that are stated, with a de re interpretation; e.g. Sp. Están sentados en la mesa --> Ha dicho que1 los invitados (#que2) ya están en su sitio). Quotative complements have the same propositional structure as the original sentence and can include some elements such as speech act adverbs -which are oriented to the original speaker (i.e. the matrix clause subject)-, Hanging Topics, or discourse connectors. On the contrary, reportative complements may be a summary of the original discourse and they have not such elements oriented to the original speaker or the previous discourse. Besides, reportative complements allow long-distance movement from the embedded CP to the matrix CP.",0

"Sign languages are known to display the same general grammatical properties as spoken languages ('Universal Grammar'), but also to make greater use of iconic mechanisms. In Schlenker et al., to appear, it was argued that  loci (= positions in signing space corresponding to discourse referents) can have an iconic semantics, in the sense that certain geometric relations among loci (subset and relative complementation, as well as high/low position relative to the signer) are preserved by the interpretation function. Here we ask whether plural and height specifications of loci display the formal behavior of phi-features in remaining uninterpreted in focus- and ellipsis-constructions (as in the bound readings of Mary admires herself, and John does too,  and of Only Mary admires herself). Data from ASL and LSF show that plural and height specifications may indeed remain uninterpreted in these constructions; furthermore, there are cases in which a single high locus is construed iconically and left uninterpreted in the course of ellipsis resolution. We argue that our data are compatible with two theories. According to the Strong View, plural and height specifications of loci display exactly the behavior of spoken language features. According to the 'Weak View', our data just show that plural and height specifications share the behavior of features and other non-assertive elements in being separable from the referential terms they specify. Our LSF data are compatible with the Weak View; our ASL might provide support for the Strong View. While we only aim to open the debate about the featural status of iconic specifications, the question is of some importance: if features are innate and primitive elements of grammar, and if some of them have an intrinsically geometric semantics, the signed modality might play a greater role than is usually thought at the very core of Universal Grammar.",1
"This paper, a commentary on Harley 2014, explores cases of disuppletive roots, such as 'destroy/destruct', 'persons/people', and 'worse/badder', the predominant approach to which is to assume that these come from different roots. We adopt a monoradical approach to such cases, claiming that they always involve the same root, but that the suppletive allomorphy is conditioned by the presence or absence of additional functional heads in the structure. We also posit that defective verbs in Spanish, an extreme case of disuppletion (whereby one of the exponents of this root is ineffable), receive a straightforward analysis as a case of contextually limited allomorphy, following Harley's postulate that certain formatives may have no elsewhere item on either the LF or the PF side (the Encyclopedic List and the Exponent List, respectively).",0
"In this paper we address the nature, syntax and semantics of clitics. Our focus is on the syntax-semantics interface, since we will attempt to provide a model for interpretation of clitics and their associate constituents. We will address the problem of so-called ""clitic doubling"", to see the semantic consequences that different syntactic configurations have, and investigate on how syntactic operations are triggered by the need to generate interface effects. We will put forth the thesis that clitics are procedural elements whose function is to license the presence of their associates and provide the semantic interface with instructions as to how to manipulate those sortal associates. Our argumentation will take elements from formal syntax (Radical Minimalism) and semantics-pragmatics (Relevance Theory) to configure an interface-based approach in which no phenomenon is studied in substantive isolation, but taking into account the interaction between different components of the system. Our aim is to provide prospects for a unified theory of the syntax-semantics of clitics, drawing on data from Spanish to support our theoretical claims.",0
"This paper deals with the diachrony of complementizer omission (C-omission) in Italian. C-omission is restricted to [-realis] clauses in Old as well as in Modern Italian, and to some types of declarative clauses in Modern Florentine (Cocchi & Poletto, 2005). This phenomenon is instead much more pervasive in the Renaissance period (Wanner 1981, Scorretti 1991) and invests basically all types of subordinate clauses. The present study concentrates on C-omission in Renaissance Italian relative clauses, which is attested in both subject and non-subject extractions. There is an asymmetry in the frequency of C-omission in subject on-subject relative clauses, which is analyzed as the result of the combination of the active/inactive alignment that characterizes both Old and Renaissance Italian, and the loss of V2. The active/inactive distinction is attributed to the presence of a strong (*) feature on the low-phase head, Voice*, whereas the loss of V2 results from a parametric change on the higher phase head: from Fin* to Fin. The argument is corroborated by further comparative facts from Old Occitan and Old French.",0
"Starting with the seminal work of Szabolcsi, morphologically unmarked and Dative-marked possessors in Hungarian have been the subject of rich investigation. Anaphoric possessive constructions, however, have remained poorly researched. In these possessives the possessor bears the mysterious -é suffix and the covert possessum is interpreted under identity with an antecedent. This paper presents new evidence in favour of Bartos' (2001) analysis of anaphoric possessives, which holds that -é is the Genitive case. I further argue that anaphoric possessives in Hungarian involve a pro-form rather than deletion of a lexical noun, and this accounts for the restricted modification of the possessum.",0
"Both 'once' and 'twice' are complex phrases (containing two visible morphemes and one silent one), rather than simple lexical items.  The presence of silent TIME with 'once' and 'twice' (and in other cases mentioned) indirectly reinforces the presence of other antecedentless silent elements in the human language faculty.  Since silent elements of this sort are not visible (even via an antecedent) in the primary data available to the learner, study of their properties, for example of their singularity or plurality, and of their licensing conditions, provides us with a privileged window onto the invariant core of the language faculty itself.",0
"In this paper we study the interaction between ellipsis and inflectional morphology and put forward a
generalization about ellipsis blocking the application of some morphological operations. Working in
the Distributed Morphology framework, we will demonstrate this generalization in the realm of NP
ellipsis. We will show that NP ellipsis can lead to stranded affix filter violations, and that there are
various strategies languages can resort to in order to resolve problems of convergence that stranded
affixes cause at the PF interface. The resolution of the stranded affix filter configuration is
responsible for the well-known observation that heads preceding NP ellipsis sites need to show overt
inflection in languages that inflect these heads (Lobeck 1995).",0
"This paper uses the realisation of locative-related roles in Balinese to show that there is noclear-cut distinction between arguments and adjuncts, supporting the gradient nature of grammatical functions (cf. Croft 2001; Langacker 1987; Aarts 2007). It argues that argumenthood is not wholly a property of a lexical head predicate and that a purely lexically based projectionist approach to syntactic argument structures cannot be maintained. It also explores the effect that the interplay between relevant properties of locatives has on their recruitability as arguments, and a novel argument-index analysis is proposed as a means to distinguish adjuncts from arguments. The analysis makes use of both general and language- specific morphosyntactic and morphosemantic tests.                                             
    Investigation of locative-related roles reveals that certain properties determine their status in the argument-adjunct continuum: thematic, individuated and animate locatives are moreargument-like than non-thematic, inanimate and general deictic locatives (in line with Kittilä2007, 2008; Peterson 2007). Interplay between these properties is shown to affect argument recruitment in Balinese, based on the value of the argument index for a given locative-relatedrole. More generally, there also is evidence that languages vary in whether they allow true adjuncts to be recruited as arguments at all",1
"In this paper I argue that Legate et al.'s (2013) ""evisceration"" of Levinson (2013) should be rejected on factual and ethical grounds. Instead of addressing shortcomings of Levinson (2013) Legate et al. add their own misrepresentations, mischaracterizations, and double standards (making the title Recursive Misrepresentations mostly self-referential). I conclude that one can hardly expect any progress in the recursion debate before the disrespectful attitude towards intellectual opponents is eliminated from bio-linguistics.",0
"In this paper, the interplay between semantic compositionality and the supposed naming function of word-formation products is investigated. Specifically, I will focus on the question of how these factors relate to the perceived novelty or ""markedness"" of newly formed compounds. For the analysis, we will concentrate on novel adjective-noun compounds, e.g., 'Blauschachtel' ('blue_box'), 'Schmalmesser' ('slim_knife') etc., with occasional glances at noun-noun compounds where relevant. We will start from a lexicalist perspective and the conventional assumption that, in German, word-formation is the preferred route for establishing a concept's name, put this assumption to several tests and prove it to be correct. In the second part of the paper, I will argue that a systematic relation holds between the markedness of an A-N compound and its interpretation as a kind name as well as its affinity to be lexicalized. Crucially, this relationship will be traced back to a pragmatic principle, which holds that deviance from a conventionalized form (that is, in our case, from a phrasal expression like 'schmales Messer' ('slim knife') implies deviance from the meaning of this form – which, in turn, results in a re-interpretation as a kind name and in semantic specialization. Consequently, interpretation as kind name and semantic specialization in compounds will be characterized as the cause for potential lexicalization and not as its effect, as is often proposed in the literature. Some remarks about the compatibility of the proposed analysis to alternative, non-rule-based approaches (e.g., Construction Grammar) will conclude my paper.",0
"This is a rewritten version of lingbuzz/001176, written as a paper rather than a talk, with numerous changes. However, the core ideas are identical, so the abstract for lingbuzz/001176 stands: Minimalist syntax has focussed a great deal on parametric variation, implementing this via featural properties of functional heads. This paper tackles individual level variability, building a minimalist type theory that allows us to capture this aspect of linguistic variation. The proposal builds on the idea that self-Merge can only be ruled out by stipulation, and removal of this stipulation allows unary branching structures into our system. I propose that these unary branching structures take the place of functional sequences, reserving binary Merge for specifiers (and hence recursion), and that they also (following Brody 2000) provide us with insertion loci for spellout. Within such a system, one is able to capture both parametric variation (as a property of which labelled functional sequences remain after acquisition) and individual level variability, as the underdetermined insertion of phonological material into these sequences. I draw out the way that the resulting theory interacts with issues of blocking, linguistic variability, and language change.",0
"The paper argues in favour of a universal DP hypothesis in articleless Czech. The data are demonstrated showing the semantic, morphological and syntactic evidence supporting the existence of a functional domain with a usually covert head above the projection of a lexical Noun. The semantic arguments are based on interpretation and binding facts. The pronominal morphology of the candidates for the lexical entries in the functional domain is compared with the Czech adjectival morphology, showing the distinction between the two. In syntactic domain the distribution and word order restrictions are demonstrated together with the results of corpora search.",0
"In this paper I compare the morphosyntax of lexical entries called Possessive (POSS) in English and Czech. I demonstrate that both the English and Czech nominal structures contain lexical and functional domains which host elements called Possessives. The interpretation of Possessives in both languages can be related to a universal thematic hierarchy distributing semantic roles between prenominal Possessives and postnominal Genitives. However, although Czech and English structures are rather similar, there are specific formal distinctions between the two, which limit their usage. Then, the languages apply comparable strategies to disambiguate and compensate for the specificity of their respective Possessives. I show that as a result of the formal distinctions in the constituent characteristics in the two languages, semantically and functionally adequate equivalents may be realised using distinct (but predictable) formal means.",0
"This study focuses on accounting for allomorphy in Latin case umber inflection. It attributes essentially all of it to the influence of adjacent features of standard segmental phonology on morphemes expressing case assignment. Indeed, other languages lead linguists to expect that allomorphy at a stem-suffix border can depend on any feature of a final vowel: ±Low, ±High, ±Round, ±Back, ±Consonantal or ±Syllabic. Empirically, it turns out that no two Latin stem-final vowels induce identical allomorphy in case umber suffixes, nor the same allomorphy as final consonants. Moreover, some (not much) phonologically conditioned allomorphy is phonetically opaque. 
These two factors have led traditional scholarship to conclude that each stem-final segment should define a separate classification of noun suffixation or ""declension"". As there are basically six types of final segment (a, o, u, i, e and consonants), each then gives rise to a different declension (stems with final i are often put in some other group or considered irregular), thus creating five (or six) declensions. Tradition then goes on to analyse stem-final vowels not as part of stems but as some kind of separate morphemes called ""thematic vowels"" (with no role in either syntax or phonology). 
This essay argues rather that an unflinching modern and formal approach to inflectional allomorphy, exactly analogous to using phonology to reduce regular English plurals to a single lexical form, succeeds in sweeping away the sandcastle of Latin declensions and better captures the actual descriptive generalizations that account for Latin case inflection.",0

"The conditions on allomorphic variation, including suppletion, play a central role in debates about the nature of the interaction between phonology and morphology and between theories that are localist versus those that are globalist. One of the central arguments for one version of a localist architecture comes from a putative generalization that selection of allomorphs is strictly local, a claim I will call the Node Adjacency Hypothesis: in particular, that the appearance of a particular outward-sensitive allomorph μ can be conditioned only by morphosyntactic features of an element that is linearly adjacent to μ. In this paper, I present two cases of outward-sensitive allomorph selection that require access to morphosyntactic features of nodes that are not adjacent to the allomorph, from Greek and from English, and show that an alternative generalization using the notion of spanning, the Span Adjacency Hypothesis, can capture these cases without permitting a range of unattested allomorphic variation.",0
"The topic of this paper can be exemplified by the final clause of the following attested sentence: 'I don't know how he found out that she belonged to that lass, but find out he has'. Clauses like this one show a preposed verb phrase that is headed by a plain verb whereas the non-preposed verb phrase of their canonical counterparts is obligatorily headed by a perfect participle (i.e. 'he has {found / *find} out)'. This peculiarity of verb phrase preposing, which will be referred to as the perfect participle paradox, has seldom been discussed. The paper starts by showing that clauses that manifest the paradox are more frequent in the Corpus of Contemporary American English and in the British National Corpus than their non-paradoxical analogues with preposed canonical perfect participles. The paper then looks at the paradox from the point of view of generative syntax, discusses and rejects previous analyses, and argues that a solution of it entails the rejection of two assumptions that have been associated with a lexicalist position, especially by proponents of distributed morphology. These are the assumptions that a) a syntactic terminal is an item supplied by the lexicon and comprising a phonological representation and b) that syntax may not manipulate the internal structure of syntactic terminals. The paper proposes an analysis that is not based on these assumptions, but argues that the analysis does not entail the superiority of a distributed morphology framework.",0
"The article contributes to the typology of structural factors constraining argument realization in nominalizations, focussing on English –er-nominals. It first reappraises the conclusions of earlier studies on when –er-nominals can express verbal arguments. Derivations disallowing argument linking (with -er and other affixes) are treated as semantically and structurally parallel to nominal compounds, and their argumentstructural behaviour is attributed to a generalization that base-generated complex heads prohibit realization of arguments of the nonhead outside the complex head, with principled exceptions. Regarding argument-realizing –er-nominals, we observe an idiolect split in which some speakers allow the full range of argument structures permitted by head movement analyses, while less liberal idiolects require a (lexicalistinspired but syntactically implemented) analysis where –er is a Voice head that selects V°, forcing arguments of V to merge above affixation as arguments of nouns, which is
only possible for PP and of-insertion arguments.",0
"Finiteness bears on issues pertaining to some of the most central properties of a clause: its tense, aspect, mood, agreement, the referential properties and case-marking of its subject and, more generally, the way in which the clause is anchored to a higher one or to the utterance context. And yet, given the increasing amount of empirical evidence challenging conventional definitions of finiteness, it remains one of the least understood concepts in linguistic theory. The series of eleven papers in this volume presents new evidence on the nature of finiteness from a number of hitherto understudied languages, namely those of the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian language families spoken in South Asia. The hope is that these papers will encourage the reader to deepen their knowledge and simultaneously question their existing view of finiteness. This introductory article sets the stage for the rest of this volume: we briefly describe the content of the individual papers included here and situate them within the larger context of the rich dialogue on finiteness.",0
"In this paper, I will present a cross-linguistic analysis of the syntax of items signalling temporal distance. Basing on insight form cartography and nanosyntax, I will shown that the mechanism of Phrasal Spell-out (and the Superset Principle) can elegantly explain why in many language 'before' and 'ago' meanings are expressed with the same word. 
Above all, I will present a previously unnoticed *ABA constraint (cf. Caha 2009; Bobaljik 2012) on lexical spans in the domain of temporal distance. The *ABA pattern will be crucial to account for possible counterexamples of Haspelmath's (1997) fairly robust descriptive generalization, which states that forms expressing spatial relations of front and back regularly express, respectively, anteriority and posteriority across languages when they are 'shifted' from space to time (namely, before ≈ in front; after ≈ back).",0
"Domains of phonological computation, i.e. strings that are computed by phonology in one go, can be identified in two ways: derivationally and representationally. In earlier models of the architecture of grammar, the former is carried out by cyclic derivation or by levels in Lexical Phonology; under current theories it is achieved through strata in Stratal Optimality Theory or phases. In the representational approach, phonologically relevant chunks are expressed as juncture phonemes in structuralism, as hash marks (#) in SPE, and, since the early 1980s, as prosodic constituency (Prosodic Word etc.) 
Since SPE, both ways of defining chunks have been considered to be compatible, and since the development of Prosodic Phonology in the early 1980s, the division of labor has been roughly defined by word size: cycles determine domains below the word level, while prosodic constituents delineate domains of word size or larger. That is, roughly, Lexical Phonology can handle strings of morphemes but cannot identify larger units because postlexical phonology is non-cyclic. Strings of words are therefore structured by prosodic constituency. 
If phase theory is on the right track, this division of labor must be wrong: the very essence of phase theory is to define items that are bigger than the word, and to send them to PF (and LF). Against this backdrop, our first goal is to show that there can only be one chunk-defining device: theory cannot afford to have the same work done twice. 
The second goal of the paper follows on from this idea. As it stands, phase theory is unable to describe all phonologically relevant chunks, as these are too small and too diverse to be delineated in the current working. In order to qualify as the only chunk-defining device in grammar, phase theory needs to be made more flexible: in other words, it needs to be adapted to the demands of phonology.
We refer to this modified version of phase theory as Modular PIC as it allows for the PIC to produce an effect in one module, but not in another.",0
"In this chapter, we aim to continue our account of word order in a simple clause in English, now considering the merge of arguments and adjuncts. At the same time we extend the feature theory and features needed in the MSyn system to obtain 'displacement' of a phrase, leaving the LF intact. Whereas Chapter 3 discussed displacement as the LF-preserving residue of 'head movement' under Agree (feature percolation and unification), this chapter discusses the displacement which is the LF-preserving residue of 'phrasal movement' under Agree. We first give a brief overview of how the grammar works, as argued for in chapters two and three. (A draft of chapter 3 is available at lingbuzz/001615). Comments very welcome.",0

The corpus was, is and will be a valuable tool that helps pursuing a goal. Its ontological status as a tool will not change, no matter how fabulous the computational power, storage capacity, access and transmission speed, and whatever the size of the corpus. The corpus is a data source among others (namely grammaticality judgements), which has specific advantages and limitations that the user needs to be aware of – like for any other tool.
Drowned in the ambient utilitarianism and project-hysteria, many people believe, overtly or tacitly (or without being aware that they do), that research which involves the building of a corpus coupled with exploitation by a ""powerful"" computer programme, is more serious than a competitor which does not. Some even believe that the whole purpose of a research project may be the creation of a corpus, and that the corpus will produce science by itself, i.e. substitute itself to reasoning and the data-expectation dialectic. The same ideology promotes the idea that whatever scientific statement is made, it needs to be statistically relevant. This is where the corpus stops being a tool, i.e. where the system goes mad. And it did on a large scale in the past decade or so. Poor corpora are in the middle of this thunderstorm, and are abundantly abused by the ideology in place.",1
"Different analyses have been applied to the distinction between CV and CVC syllabic reduplication in Hiaki (Yaqui), which has a complex system of reduplicative allomorphy. Haugen 2003 proposes that CVC reduplication is dependent upon the syllable structure of the verb (an onset consonant of the second syllable of a verb stem cannot serve as a coda in a reduplicant), but Harley & Leyva 2009 regard CVC reduplication as copying CVC roots. This paper demonstrates that neither approach is fully adequate to account for all cases of syllabic reduplication in Hiaki. Rather, Hiaki grammar references both roots (morphological constituents) and syllable structure (prosodic constituents) for different classes of reduplication. Prosodic base-dependence at the level of the syllable is typologically rare but not otherwise unattested in syllabic reduplication.",0
"Bobaljik (2012) proposes a stringent locality constraint on the conditioning of suppletion: the
insertion of suppletive vocabulary items can be sensitive to features within the same maximal projection, but not across a maximal projection boundary. Among heads (X˚ nodes), this condition restricts suppletion to synthetic formations and excludes suppletion in analogous analytic formations. A large survey of suppletion in comparative and superlative formation revealed numerous examples of root suppletion triggered by the comparative affix, while no examples of a pattern in which root suppletion is triggered by a free-standing comparative adverb were found, entirely consistent with the locality condition on suppletion.

Hiaki provides examples of apparent conditioning of suppletion in phrasal constructions, which seem to constitute prima facie counter-examples. The number of a subject DP can trigger suppletion of the verb in a certain class of intransitive verbs. We show that these apparent counterexamples do not in fact contradict Bobaljik's 2012 generalization, as the verbs in question can be shown by language-internal diagnostics to be unaccusative; suppletion, then, is in fact triggered by an element within the maximal projection of the suppleting verb. The analysis supports the position in Kratzer 1996, Marantz, 1997, Harley 2011, that internal arguments are base-generated as sisters to their selecting verb, rather than in a separate functional projection. Only in this configuration do the number suppletion facts form a single generalization with the facts from comparative suppletion. The Hiaki suppletion examples make the additional, and important, point, that the locality condition in (1) is not tantamount to a distinction between word-internal and word-external triggers of suppletion, but is rather a condition of structural locality, supporting the central tenet of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993) that morphological structure is, in a fundamental way, syntactic.",0
"Romance nouns display a well-known case of plural isogloss. This consists of two groups of languages: those pluralizing by suffixating -s (cf. Spanish), and those pluralizing by changing the quality of the final vowel (cf. Italian).
In this paper, I propose an explanation to the morphological isogloss. More precisely, I argue that the cross-linguistic diversity within Romance depends on morpho-phonological parameters on the structure of the noun. These parameters consist of language-particular restrictions on the form of the (nominal) roots and the exponents of gender and number.",0

"This dissertation develops a unified syntax for what is often called sentence negation (SN) and constituent negation (CN). I argue that a negative marker, which is usually considered an indivisible unit, can be decomposed into four subatomic features, which can each take scope in a different position in the clause. Under this approach negation is viewed as a complex predicate negator.
This dissertation consists of four parts. The first part introduces the topic and the empirical domain and provides the necessary theoretical background. In the second part the internal syntax of negation is investigated and the third part focusses on how the link between the internal syntax and the external syntax of negation can be established. The final part provides support for the account and extends the proposal.
The empirical trigger for the decomposition of the negative marker into subatomic features is the observation that there are syncretisms between markers expressing SN and markers expressing CN in some languages. From a nanosyntactic perspective syncretism patterns are meaningful. They point to hidden or underlying structure within a unit that is thought of as indivisible. The research hypothesis in this dissertation is therefore that there meaningful syncretism patterns within the domain of negative markers.
In order to be able to detect syncretisms it is necessary to know which types of negative markers there are. On the basis of four properties of negative markers, namely 1) their scope, 2) their ability to stack on other negative markers, 3) their semantic label and 4) their function, a classification of four types of negative marker is made. I distinguish negative polarity markers (PolNeg), focus markers (FocNeg), degree markers (DegNeg) and quantity markers (QNeg).
By means of this four-way classification I look at nine different languages and I detect syncretism patterns within the domain of negative markers. Starting from this ob- servation, the negative marker which is now considered the set of all negative markers, can be decomposed into its subatomic features: N1, N2, N3, N4. From a nanosyntactic perspective every feature corresponds to a syntactic head. This leads to the hierarchical organization of these four features into a binary negative nanospine. I furthermore argue that this negative nanospine is inserted as a complex constituent in the specifier of an abstract semantically negative head, more precisely SpecNegP.

On the basis of the negative nanospine and reconstruction effects I argue in the next part that NegP is base-generated on a lexical predicate. Negation is thus perceived of as a predicate negator rather than a propositional negator, which can have four negative features in its specifier. These negative markers determine the scope of the abstract negator, but are themselves not semantically negative. They are negative scope markers rather than negators.
Furthermore I explain how the features in the nanospine take scope in the positions in the clause. The four positions in the clause that I distinguish for negative scope are PolP, FocP, DegP and QP. I develop a valuation-driven feature system which allows interactions between the markers in the nanospine and the clausal scope projections. The account provides support for a feature system which allows uninterpretable but valued features to be deleted without checking. Checking or not checking leads to interpretative differences.

In a final part I discuss how intervention effects caused by the modal auxiliary must and quantificational adverbs provide support for the proposal developed in this dissertation. I extend the proposal to French negation and I show how the system can capture diachronic change.",1
"In this paper, we address the unproductivity of irregular verbal ""L""-patterns in Portuguese, Italian and Spanish diachronically in a corpus linguistic study. Using openly available corpora, we answer two questions systematically: firstly whether the size of an active lexicon of a speaker/community remains constant, and secondly, whether the productivity of the regular verbal forms in the first
conjugation -ar(e) increases over time and is a function of verb vocabulary size. By running random sampling simulations on both large and small corpora from different sources for each language, we found a consistent increase, especially after 1750, in both verb vocabulary size and productivity of the regular verbal form -ar(e). The results suggested that productivity of the
regular verbal form is likely to be caused by the increase in verb vocabulary size, and as more new verbs come into a language, they will most likely fall into the first conjugation. This increase in the ratio of new verbs being assigned to the first conjugation caused the irregular forms in the second
and third conjugations -er(e) and -ir(e) to become less productive over time. Finally, we speculate that the 1750 shift across all corpora is possibly caused by the industrial revolution which started around 1760.",0
"Basing my conclusions on Mainland Scandinavian, primarily Swedish, I argue that a strict division has to be made between three concepts or dimensions of gender: formal gender, semantic gender and lexical gender. Lexical gender is a salient meaning component of a noun; this dimension of gender is syntactically inert. Semantic gender is a category of thought, conveyed by pronominal resources. Semantic genders are for instance categories such as MALE – FEMALE, COUNTABLE – NON-COUNTABLE, and ANIMATE – NON-ANIMATE. Formal gender is a piece of phonology that is added post-syntactically to a derivation. The three dimensions are clearly separate, but they interact, and the pronominal forms associated with the different dimensions are sometimes identical, which might blur the picture.
The formal gender features have basically the same status as the phonological features of a root. Thus, formal gender does not carry any inherent meaning, but participates in the spell-out of semantic distinctions, for example ANIMATE – INANIMATE. Of particular importance is the idea that the feature NEUTER is used in Mainland Scandinavian to spell out the absence of a number feature, which accounts for neuter agreement on so-called pancake sentences. An effect is that NEUTER in such contexts corresponds to NON-COUNTABILITY.
Drawing on work done in the 80s (Bosch 1983, 1986; Cornish 1983), I argue that it is necessary to distinguish between pronouns that refer to a linguistic entity, for example a DP, and pronouns that refer to a discourse entity. This is, in fact, what lies behind they properties of hybrid nouns (Corbett 1991), which are cases where the two ways of making reference make use of different pronominal forms. For Swedish the pronouns den (it.C) 'it' and det (it.N) 'it' are carefully discussed. It is shown that these pronouns can be used for reference to noun phrases, where the head nouns are formally COMMON GENDER or NEUTER, as well as to to COUNTABLE or NON-COUNTABLE discourse entities.
The analyses are based on Swedish and Mainland Scandinavian, but an out-look is made to some related languages.",0
"'Lateral' grammaticalization (Chinese de and shi) is similar to yet different from grammaticalization in Minimalism, since while both involve 'structural simplification', the latter displays 'phonological weakening', 'univerbation' and 'semantic bleaching' which the former does not (Tse (2013a, b)). There is another functional category which is not analysed in Roberts and Roussou's (2003) Minimalist account of grammaticalization, namely K(case), which is postulated to represented morphological case (van Kemenade and Vincent (1997:18-21)). An analysis of case-markers (K) in Chinese (ba) suggests that they are 'laterally' grammaticalized, which is significant for Chinese and modern Case theory since it entails that K(case) is not universal and cannot be equated with abstract Case.",0
"This dissertation provides a novel perspective on direct object marking. I essentially argue that object agreement markers are the spell-out on verbs of differential object markers base-generated within direct objects.The theory is developed in the Nanosyntactic framework on the basis of Hungarian data. It is then extended to lay the foundations for a nanosyntactic analysis of direct object marking cross-linguistically. 
I start with an introduction to the Nanosyntactic framework. Then, I present the phenomenon of object agreement in Hungarian, in which the definiteness of a direct object is morphologically encoded on the finite verb. I then proceed to a meticulous decomposition of Hungarian pronominal direct objects and object agreement markers. I show that the latter are the spell out of a structural layer base-generated within the former. Subsequently, I extend the analysis to Hungarian full direct object DPs. On the basis of cross-linguistic differential object marking data, I argue that the structure of definite direct objects contains (at least) one more layer than the structure of indefinite direct objects. This additional layer is usually spelled out by a preposition or a morpheme affixed on direct objects. In Hungarian, however, this layer raises to the vicinity of the verb (I argue that this movement is triggered by QR). Hence, contra traditional approaches, definiteness marking of a direct object in Hungarian does not result from a feature valuation mechanism between a verb and its direct object but from the spell-out on the verb of a differential object marker. 
Finally, I suggest to extend this analysis of direct object agreement to other languages such as Ostyak, Swahili and French.",0
"In this paper, I discuss Austro-Bavarian directionals which adhere to the following pattern: preposition plus suffix -a or -i, as for example in ""auffa"" (upwards-a) and ""auffi"" (upwards- i). They indicate that movement occurs either towards the speaker's location (-a) or towards a location distinct from the speaker's location (-i). I argue that this alternation is an overt manifestation the semantic universal of central versus non-central coincidence as proposed by Hale (1986). I analyze the directionals as fully fledged PathPs whose internal syntax is based on Ritter and Wiltschko's (2009) implementation of the coincidence theme. These directionals show that dialectal data can confirm both semantic and syntactic universals that have been argued for on the basis of entirely unrelated domains and languages.",0
"This dissertation is concerned with the deictic and grammatical category person and its associated linguistic expressions: indexical, i.e. first and second person, pronouns. Under the hypothesis that sentence meaning is computed from how words and their associated lexical information combine with each other, indexical pronouns present an interesting challenge: their actual referent can only be determined once interpreted with respect to the utterance context they are being used in. Formulated within the Chomskyan framework of generative syntax, this thesis develops a novel approach to the relationship between the morphosyntactic content, the interpretational ranges, and the associated crosslinguistic variation of these pronouns. Primarily based on data from Dutch, English, German (Indoeuropean), and Blackfoot (Algonquian), the main conclusion of this thesis is that person is derivative of spatiotemporal information: Firstly, temporal information plays a crucial role in its interpretation. Secondly, spatial information contributes the necessary contextual anchoring. Empirically, this dissertation draws on data from the domains of genericity, possession, tense, and modality. On the basis of this evidence it is shown that the spatiotemporal information underlying indexical pronouns is also encoded morphosyntactically. From a broader perspective, this dissertation addresses questions concerning the relation between context and syntax, morphology and syntax, as well as syntax and semantics.",0
"This is an invited commentary on an NLLT article by Berit Gehrke ('Adjectival participles, event kind modification and pseudo-incorporation'). Like the commented-on article, it mainly focusses on the constraints on by-phrases and modifiers with (German) adjectival participles. It critically examines Gehrke's claims, including the claims that the modifiers are pseudo-incorporated into the participle and that participles refer to event kinds rather than event tokens. It points out problems for these claims, but the overall picture is a slightly modified version of Gehrkes approach.",0
"In Distributed Morphology, the term 'root' names a particular theoretical construct which plays an important role in the framework. Here, empirical evidence is brought to bear which illuminates the nature of roots in this model. It is argued that neither phonological properties nor semantic properties are sufficient to individuate root nodes in the syntax. In consequence, a purely formal notion of root identity is needed for use in syntactic computation, to which phonological and/or semantic properties can be attached at the relevant point, both potentially contingent upon particular morphosyntactic contexts.  The conclusion is that syntactic roots are individuated as pure units of structural computation, lacking (in the syntax) both semantic content and phonological features. Following (Pfau 2000; Pfau 2009) and (Acquaviva 2008), an index notation is adopted, according to which individual syntactic roots are referred to simply by a numerical address. The idea is that the address serves as the linkage between a set of instructions for phonological realization in context and a set of instructions for semantic interpretation in context.  Having established this framework, the paper asks how do root nodes behave in the syntactic component, and what kinds of conditions are imposed on their semantic and/or phonological interpretation at the interfaces? In the second half of this paper, arguments are given that roots can and do take complements and project, and again, the empirical basis for the argument draws on  both semantic and morphophonological data, as well as syntactic evidence. It is clear that different morphosyntactic environments can trigger special meanings and pronunciations of roots. Some recent proposals (Marantz 2001; Marantz 2008; Arad 2003; Arad 2005) argue for a very stringent locality condition on root interpretations. With  (Borer 2009), I argue that the constraints cannot be quite so restrictive, and argue for a return to the view of the relevant locality domain originally advanced in (Marantz 1995b; Marantz 1997), according to which the projection which hosts the external argument marks the domain edge.",0
"This paper centers on the nature of partial pro-drop languages in Northern Italian
dialects and Brazilian Portuguese. I propose that the distribution of overt and null subjects in
these languages provides evidence for an analysis of the null subject parameter in terms of
ellipsis. In particular, I defend the idea that nominative subjects are deleted at PF in consistent
null subject languages through what I call head ellipsis, a morphological operation subjected
to the same locality conditions that other post-syntactic operations. Head ellipsis dictates
when and how a particular syntactic object should be pronounced. Thus, Northern Italian
dialects are seen as null subject languages with some subjects phonetically realized by the
same reasons that apply in other cases of multiple copy realization. In turn, Brazilian
Portuguese is a non-null subject language with some null subjects. Crucially, these subjects
are not the result of morphological head ellipsis, but of another syntactic mechanism of
licensing.",0
"An all too common situation in linguistics is that the data underdetermine the proper analysis. This paper deals with a concrete case, namely the analysis of the present tense agreement paradigm of Standard Dutch. Many possible analyses can and have been proposed to capture two basic facts: (i) the distribution of three distinct affixes accross the paradigm space and (ii) the fact that in 2sg contexts the -t is dropped in inversion orders.

A look at the straight and inversion order paradigms of agreement inflection in 267 varieties of Dutch reveals the existence of four exceptionless generalizations on paradigm structure. Under the assumption that these generalizations act as restrictions on the variation space, probably brought in through the process of language acquisition, the number of possible analyses for a single synchronic paradigm, including the standard Dutch one, is drastically reduced. We provide the first analysis of the Standard Dutch agreement paradigm that is compatible with these restrictions. In addition, we claim that two different types of inversion morphology can be theoretically as well as empirically distinguished.

"This article addresses the derivational relationship between attributive (nominal) and predicative (verbal) possessives marked by the POSS sign in American Sign Language. Though traditionally classified as a possessive pronoun, a collection of morphological, syntactic, and semantic patterns is presented here as evidence that POSS instead displays the distributional characteristics of a verbal predicate in the language. Classifying POSS as a verbal predicate of possession explains its presence in predicative possessives and allows its attributive use to be derived from this underlying verbal structure as an instance of a prenominal reduced relative clause modifier. These base structures and their interaction with other components of the predicative and attributive domains explain the documented properties of attributive and predicative poss possessives, including, crucially, the sometimes divergent behaviors of these two possessive constructions.",0
"This article is an addendum to recent contributions on the structure of compounds in root-based frameworks (Borer 2009, Harley 2009). It presents a subtype of Dutch primary compounds of which the non-head is demonstrably a bare root. The non-head of this type of compounding is fully acategorial. It does not contain categorial heads (i.e. little heads) or functional projections. As such, the discussion supports the hypothesis that the most minimal lexical projection is a root (Halle and Marantz 1993, Borer 2005). Given that the non-heads of these compounds consist of nothing but bare roots, they are an important testing ground to study the behavior of lexical projections in the absence of functional projections. As a first illustration of this methodological advantage, I present primary compounds which contain more than two roots and I show that they may contain idiomatic clusters which do not correspond to constituents. I argue that word idiomaticity should be distinguished from sentential idiomaticity (Borer 2013, to appear), which depends on constituency.",1
"This article argues that important constraints on the properties of derived nominals can only be explained if complex words, and

"The notion of complexity recurrently shows up in the context of language studies. From a Chomskyan/biolinguistic perspective, and given the uniform character of language acquisition, it has been assumed that all languages are equally complex or simple. However, the proper focus of Chomskyan linguistics is not natural languages, but the language faculty. Here, we discuss complexity in this domain, relying on Deacon's (2006) distinction between various levels of complexity. The discussion focuses on grammars of I(nternal)-languages and how these display traces of cumulative complexity (Deacon's third level) that go beyond the narrow confines of internalism. Focusing on instances of recent (sign) language emergence, and evidence from birdsongs, we argue that biolinguistics would be wrong to ignore what it can learn from how socio-cultural factors affect the linguistic phenotype.",0
"This paper outlines an analysis of compound stress in English, which has remained a persistent puzzle at the phonological, syntactic, and morphological interfaces. The analysis is a straightforward extension of previous work in the Distributed Morphology and Phase Theory frameworks, providing insights into several problems in the analysis of English compounds. Special rules for compound stress are shown to be unnecessary, and can be unified with rules for sentential stress. Finally, a simple structural distinction between complement and adjunct structures is shown to provide the basis for the apparently complex typology of both noun-noun
and adjective-noun modificational structures in English.",0
"In the nonconcatenative morphology of Semitic languages, syntactic features can be realized by prosodic changes to a stem. The degree to which phonology controls the word shape and nonconcatenative morphological alternations in these languages has been up for debate ever since the first autosegmental account of Arabic morphology related the two by mapping morphemes non linearly onto stored prosodic templates (McCarthy 1981). This article, however, argues that seemingly nonconcantenative morphology is indeed best represented concatenatively as discrete phonological pieces realizing morphosyntactic features. The resulting morphophonological effects can be separated from prosodic factors that affect the entire word. In support of this hypothesis, I examine locality effects in allomorphy selection and the interaction of morphophonological and phonological processes in the Semitic languages Arabic and
Akkadian, showing that in both cases, apparently nonconcatenative morphemes in fact show structural sensitivity, which can only be captured in a piece based theory of morphology where realization of syntactic features is separate from phonological constraints.",0
"This article studies the emergence of ambiguity in communication through the concept of logical irreversibility and within the framework of Shannon's information theory. This leads us to a precise and general expression of the intuition behind Zipf's vocabulary balance in terms of a symmetry equation between the complexities of the coding and the decoding processes that imposes an unavoidable amount of logical uncertainty in natural communication. Accordingly, the emergence of irreversible computations is required if the complexities of the coding and the decoding processes are balanced in a symmetric scenario, which means that the emergence of ambiguous codes is a necessary condition for natural communication to succeed.",0
"Snyder (2001) proposes the compounding parameter that governs the productivity of compounding and the acceptability of complex predicate constructions in languages.

It is claimed that the compounding parameter does not need to be assumed in the morphosyntax and in the process of languages acquisition.",0
"This paper proposes a non-paradigmatic analysis of the Basque case system that facilitates a unified analysis of two anomalies in the distribution of the locative in Basque, namely the unexpected lack of exponence of the definite singular locative throughout the directional cases and in the scope of the adnominal linker -ko. These anomalies are analysed as effects of contextually conditioned zero spell-out of the locative morpheme and the singular determiner. Based on Embick's (2010) theory of cyclic spell-out, the present analysis predicts two cross-linguistic restrictions on morpheme interactions in the nominal domain.",0
"This paper presents a previously unobserved pattern of morphological blocking in English causatives, which parallels a well-studied pattern of morphological blocking in Japanese causatives (Kuroda, 1965, a.o.). We present evidence of deep parallels between the English and Japanese causatives along with a detailed syntax/semantics for these structures within the framework of Distributed Morphology. We argue that the blocking effect is sensitive not to structural adjacency, as previously argued for Japanese (Harley, 2008), but instead to linear adjacency. Our findings constitute a strong argument for the post-syntactic resolution of derivational morphology, pace Distributed Morphology and contra the Lexicalist Hypothesis. In particular, the sensitivity to linear adjacency shows that the operations relevant to the blocking effect must occur post-linearization, and therefore contributes to our understanding of the timing of post-syntactic operations.",0
"This paper discusses the morphological passive (the so-called -s(t) passive) in Swedish, Danish, Bokmål and Nynorsk. There are two problematic aspects about the morphological passive: (1) in all the languages mentioned except Swedish, it is restricted to certain tenses and/or conjugation classes, and (2) from a theoretical perspective, it constitutes what looks like a mirror violation: the passive voice-marker surfaces outside of the tense-marker, even though it arguably originates between tense and the lexical verb. I argue that previous analyses of the passive -s(t) as either a clitic realizing the external argument (Julien 2007), or as a mood marker (Heltoft and Jakobsen 1996) can neither explain the tense/declension class restrictions, nor the semantics of the  -s(t)-passive. I argue instead that morphological passives in Danish, Bokmål and Nynorsk never contain a tense projection, and they are licensed in finite contexts when the finite form is form-identical with a non-finite form, that ``fools'' the syntax in the C-phase of the clause (where at least some of the underlying syntactic features of the lexical items are no longer active). In Swedish on the other hand, the tensed forms are licensed through Tense-copying, which is known to exist in Swedish to a much higher degree than in the other Scandinavian languages (Wiklund 2007). My proposal thus gets the around mirror-violation, and manages to relate the variation in restrictions on morphological passives to other familiar differences between the languages, namely differences in conjugation classes and the availability of tense copying.",0
"The central question of this short article is how the internal structure of a participial phrase affects its external distribution. I will argue that all participles have the distribution of adjectives, though the presence of event-structure in some participles makes them illicit in certain typical adjectival contexts where either certain scalar properties or stativity is selected for. Most importantly, I will show that postulating a categorial split between 'adjectival' participles and 'verbal' participles is neither semantically, morphologically, nor syntactically motivated. I will further argue that the theory of lexical categories of Baker (2003) provides a good tool for dealing with participles of different types. I will also claim that the distribution of event-structure nominalizations is restricted by similar factors to those restricting the distribution of event-structure participles.",0

I adduce empirical evidence and conceptual arguments both speaking against the analysis proposed by Franks & Lavine (2006), and argue for a different account based on recent ""non-orthodox"" proposals in case theory. My analysis of the Lithuanian constructions is inspired by a typological comparison with Australian languages possessing ""complementizing"" and ""associating"" case marking and morpho-logical case-stacking. I propose that the mechanism of multiple case assignment in syntax is operative in Lithuanian and show how it can naturally account for the Dative-plus-Infinitive and Genitive-plus-Infinitive constructions.",0
"This paper identifies a deletion phenomenon in Kĩsêdjê and discusses it within the framework of Optimal Interleaving (Wolf 2008). In order to account for the Kĩsêdjê phenomenon, I have to formalize an aspect of Wolf's system that is left vague in his original formulation, namely, the size of the domain that is input to morphophonological evaluation. I conclude that morphophonology evaluates abstract prosodic phrases.",0
"It is argued that the distribution of European Portuguese (EP) inflected infinitives in instances of Obligatory Control (OC) follows very closely that of case independence in Russian. These facts are taken as evidence in favour of Landau's (2000, 2004, 2008) contention that there are two kinds of OC. Departing from Landau, however, and more in line with Cinque (2006), van Urk (2010) and Grano (2012), it is argued that one kind of OC involves movement whereas the other involves failed movement, whereby an agreed-with pro cannot raise to absorb a second theta-role for principled reasons, resulting in Partial Control. Other differences, it is argued, can be attributed to independently attested differences between the two languages (e.g. multiple wh-movement in Russian, availability of null comitatives in EP).",0
"Argument ellipsis in Javanese exhibits a subject-object asymmetry with respect to sloppy/quantificational interpretations. Adopting the LF-Copy theory of null arguments developed in Japanese and Turkish (Oku 1998; Takahashi 2008a, b; Şener and Takahashi 2010), I argue that this asymmetry falls out from the dyadic voice agreement system in Javanese where a single DP is specifically picked up by voice prefixes on v to mark the Actor-Topic or Theme-Topic alignments. I show that this agreement blocks the LF-Copy process from targeting empty subject positions. This result suggests that voice agreement is to be included in the general theory of agreement, together with φ-agreement.",0
"Degree achievements and directed motion verbs are standardly taken to describe events in which an individual undergoes change over time. The spatial uses of these verbs, giving rise to what are known as their extent readings, indicate that a temporal change based semantics is not general enough to capture their behavior. In this paper, we introduce a further range of facts that argues for a fully general analysis of the meaning of degree achievements and directed motion verbs in terms of value difference rather than temporal change. These verbs are uniformly analyzed as intensional verbs that take functional arguments and encode a difference in the value of this argument over a contextually given ordered domain. This analysis accounts naturally for their interaction with a range of adverbial modifiers.",0
"Embick (2012) argues that insertion into terminal nodes (aka ""morpheme insertion only"", or MIO) is preferable over insertion into non-terminals (aka, INT) within realizational theories of morphology. Embick (2012) provides two key arguments: double marking and the containment prediction. In this paper we respond to both criticisms of INT. We show that double marking is an artifact of the aggressive decomposition mandated by terminal-only insertion, and that containment is a problem for terminal-only insertion just as it is for non-terminal insertion. We
then propose an alternative to both models which employs insertion that realizes many contiguous members of the string of features present after linearization. We argue that this proposal appears to better account for the data under discussion.",0
"Researchers using different methods have converged on the result that subject relative clauses (RCs) are easier to process than object RCs. Cross-linguistic evidence for the subject processing advantage (SPA) has come mostly from accusative languages where grammatical function and case correspond, preventing researchers from investigating whether case or grammatical function underlies the SPA. Ergative languages allow for the separation of case and function, since more than one case is associated with the subject position. Prior results on the processing of ergative languages suggest that function and case are equally important in RC processing and differential effects are also visible. The ergative cues the projection the absolutive object, which gives preference to the absolutive, but the ergative is also preferred as subject. This paper tests these findings by examining the processing of RCs in Ch'ol and Q'anjob'al, two head- initial ergative languages that mark ergativity via agreement. The results again support the SPA but do not show any cueing by the ergative agreement marker. We conclude that case is superior to agreement in tracking grammatical function, and in the absence of case cues, structural preferences become more pronounced. Therefore the SPA is evident in both ergative and accusative languages.",1
"We argue that class features in Hiaki are not properties of roots in the syntax but rather are properties of Vocabulary Items. Irregular morphophonological rules (Readjustment Rules) apply to a particular class of Vocabulary Items in the appropriate morphosyntactic environment. Classifications of this kind play no role in the syntactic/semantic computation, but are crucial in triggering the application of the appropriate morphophonological rule to yield the correct surface form in such cases. The existence of such morphophonological classifications, irrelevant to syntax, is thus an argument against the lexeme, as such, and in favor of the DM-style separation of the two lists: List 1, input to the syntax (the source of the Numeration in Minimalist syntactic theories), and List 2, Vocabulary Items which simply realize the output of the syntax. Further, the Hiaki case provides a clear argument for Vocabulary Insertion applying to Root elements (l-morphemes, in Harley & Noyer 2000's terminology), as well as to f-morphemes. In addition, the notion of a phasal cycle within the word proves useful in permitting a simple statement of the relevant conditioning context for the application of morphophonological rules.",1
"The primary aim of this paper is to propose a phrasal set-up of the quantificational domain in the nominal hierarchy of projections that accounts for the differing linearizational and inflectional properties of strong and weak quantifiers in German in the sense of Milsark (1974, 1977). I argue that the German bare vs. inflected universal quantifier dichotomy constitutes a solid basis for the proposal of two diverging quantifier phrases (QP). Additionally, evidence is put forth for the existence of two discrete possessive heads (Poss0). The main difference between these two instances will be found in their value of grammatical definiteness due to their varying positions. With these axioms combined, we arrive at a symmetrical bisection of [±definite] QP and PossP encircling the nominal core categories D and N, respectively. I also make use of this phrasal configuration to develop an algorithm for the evaluation of morphological form on strong quantifiers, which is arguably also applicable in further instances of morphological evaluation, namely the division of strong/weak adjective inflection in exceptional case-marking configurations. In addition, the analysis proposed thereby allows pinning down the locus of application of said algorithm at an early stage in the phonological component: the subcomponent Morphology (Chomsky 1995).",1

"This paper addresses the emergence of a novel impersonal pronoun ('anne') in a southern Italian variety. The development of this impersonal pronoun is following a rather unusual path, seeming to be the result of the re-adaptation of an auxiliary borrowed from Italian. 

The diachronic development of two competing impersonal pronouns is analyzed, showing that they follow opposite paths. While one is a pronoun grammaticalizing into a plural marker, the other is an auxiliary degrammaticalizing into an arbitrary pronoun.",0

"Nominal wh-questions (nonprepositional arguments) in Indonesian-type languages have received two principal analyses in recent years. Based on the three different surface strategies for forming these questions, Saddy (1991) has proposed distinct in situ, long distance-movement, and partial-movement analyses for Indonesian. Cole & Hermon (1998) adopt the same general proposal for Malay. Conversely, examining the three parallel structures, Davies (2003) has proposed that there is no interclausal wh-movement in Madurese but that all nominal wh-arguments are generated in situ. Sundanese presents the same basic structural options as the other three languages. Examining the grammatical characteristics of the long distance questions, we conclude that, as in Madurese, there is no evidence for interclausal A¢-movement in Sundanese and that the apparent cases of long-distance movement are best analyzed as instances of A-movement. These questions thus appear to share some characteristics of nominal wh-questions in other western Austronesian languages, such as Malagasy (Keenan 2008) and Tagalog (Gerassimova & Sells 2008).",0
"The term Vocabulary Insertion (henceforth VocIns) refers to the mechanism through which vocabulary items such as 'the' or 'book' are inserted into the syntactic derivation. In this paper we re-examine VocIns from the point of view of DM and argue that it is in need of revision.
The DM system of VocIns is set up such that lexical vocabulary items (LVIs) are inserted into root terminal nodes (RTNs) and functional vocabulary items (FVIs) are inserted into functional terminal nodes (FTNs). Generally speaking, though, if there are two types of terminal nodes and two types of vocabulary items and if VocIns is characterized as the pairing of a terminal node with a vocabulary item, there should in principle be four types of pairings. They are listed in (1).
(1)	a. FVIs in FTNs, b. LVIs in RTNs, c. FVIs in RTNs, d. LVIs in FTNs
The options in (1)a and (1)b are the ones that are allowed by the analysis just outlined, while (1)c-d are ruled out. However, whether or not these final two patterns occur is ultimately an empirical question, one which is rarely taken up in the DM-literature on VocIns, if at all. The present paper aims to fill this void. We examine cases where FVIs show up in RTNs as well as instances of LVIs occurring in FTNs. We argue that while the former pattern is real (and thus constitutes evidence against the standard DM-approach to VocIns), the latter is only apparent. We present a modified theory of VocIns from which this asymmetric picture follows.",0
"This paper addresses a recent proposal by Katzir (2011) for the existence of a new functional category called a licensor.  Drawing on data from Danish, Icelandic, and Greek, Katzir argues that incorporating licensors provides an elegant account of otherwise puzzling patterns of definiteness and gender marking in the languages.  In this paper, we look beyond the data presented by Katzir, revealing morphological patterns in Icelandic and Danish that are predicted to be impossible under Katzir's theory.  Thus, we contend that these languages do not support the existence of licensors.  Instead, we propose an account within the framework of Distributed Morphology, arguing that the patterns of gender and definiteness marking seen in Danish and Icelandic are the result of competition for insertion between well-motivated vocabulary items.  In a sense, then, we argue for a more traditional and theoretically simpler analysis of agreement in the languages.",0
"In this paper we consider the morphosyntax of so-called prepositions (PrePs) in 
Amharic.  It is typologically anomalous that Amharic should have prepositions, since it is otherwise a fairly canonical head-final language.  Instead, we argue that the PrePs are really morphological prefixes that express the oblique case assigned to NP by a postposition (null or overt).  What is somewhat unusual about Amharic, then, is where this prefix shows up in complex nominals. We argue that the case feature is not manifested on the first word of the NP, or the last word, or the noun head, but rather on the structurally highest element of the nominal, defined recursively.  This explains the position of the PreP in nominals that have one or more adjectival modifiers, demonstratives, possessor expressions, and relative clauses, as well as its special location in verbal noun constructions.  We briefly contrast our analysis with one that makes use only of leftward 
movement in the syntax, and we compare the distribution of the oblique case prefixes with that of the definiteness suffix –u and the accusative case suffix -n.",0
"In this paper, we investigate the case split on the possessor in Udmurt.
Traditionally, the choice between ablative and genitive possessor case is
said to be driven by the grammatical function (GF) of the XP containing
the possessor. Given this generalization, an analysis of the case alternation
in Udmurt within a strictly derivational framework runs into a
look-ahead problem. We argue that the case split is not driven by GFs;
rather, it is determined by the case value of the XP that contains the
possessor. Importantly, we argue that there is no evidence for a possessor
raising analysis in Udmurt. We present an analysis according to
which the possessor always bears genitive but may be assigned another
structural case by an external head. Due to a morphological constraint,
stacked case features fuse into a single feature set in the postsyntactic
morphological component. If accusative and genitive stack on the possessor,
only the default semantic case marker, i.e., the ablative marker,
can realize the resulting feature set. In any other context the genitive
marker is chosen. We thus claim that there is no abstract ablative on the
possessor; instead, the morphological ablative marker realizes a combination
of two abstract structural cases.",0
"Theories of allomorph selection differ in the extent to which they allow the realization of morphemes closer to the root to be sensitive to the phonological shape of more peripheral morphemes. In parallel OT, all aspects of word pronunciation are determined at once, and so in principle any portion of the word could affect any other. Many alternative approaches posit that morphemes are realized one at a time (serially), beginning with the root and proceeding outwards. If this is stringently the case, no phonologically-conditioned outward-sensitive allomorphy should exist. 

 In this paper we discuss new evidence from Nez Perce in support of an intermediate position. The right theory, we propose, is partly, but not purely, ""inside-out serial"". It is cyclic domains that are spelled out one at a time, proceeding from inner domains to outer ones. But within a cyclic domain, if the domain contains multiple morphemes, these may be realized in a non-inside-out fashion: either in parallel, or outside-in.  We show how the Nez Perce facts can be accommodated both in a revised version of Distributed Morphology (which we call ""DM with Insertion by Phase"") and in Stratal OT.",0
"The present study mainly aims to describe the mechanics of causative-inchoative alternation in modern Persian as well as the causative structure of its verbal system. In this scope, we provide a brief description of the phrase structure of the modern Persian and discuss its main causative-inchoative codification strategies: morphological, lexical and analytic causatives. When giving Persian examples, we use the Transcription procedure for Iranian toponymic items implemented by the Iranian National Committee on the Standardization of Geographic names and subsequently adopted and approved by the United Nations in 2012.",0
"The focus of this thesis is the description and analysis of clausal complementation in Sundanese, an Austronesian language spoken in Indonesia. The thesis examined a range of clausal complement types in Sundanese, which consists of (i) yén/(wi)réhna 'that' complements, (ii) pikeun 'for' complements, (iii) sangkan/supaya garah/sina 'so that' complements, (iv) raising complements, (v) crossed control complements, and (vi) nominalizations. This varied set of complement structures display distinct properties in terms of the sort of elements admitted in the complements.
The theoretical aspect of the thesis is the examination of two important
generalizations: (i) that complementation is a universal feature of human languages (Noonan 1985, 2007); and (ii) the well-accepted precept that finiteness plays a role in the world's languages. This thesis provides evidence that Sundanese evinces (syntactic) complementation and that any claim to the contrary is unfounded. In terms of finiteness,
despite the lack of overt morphological manifestations of finiteness, the thesis argues that finiteness seems to be at work in Sundanese and that it operates as it does in other languages to account for the distribution of overt subjects.",0
"In this paper I develop an analysis of person encoding in local scenarios (combinations where both arguments of a transitive verb are local person) that derives three empirical generalizations:  (i) the four different realization strategies found cross-linguistically in local scenarios, (ii) the asymmetry in the number of arguments encoded on the verb in local vs. non-local scenarios that arises in some languages (one argument encoded in non-local scenarios but two encoded in local scenarios), and (iii) the fact that person portmanteaux are particularly prominent in local scenarios. I claim that all three generalizations can be derived in a relativized probing approach where a probe can only target local person arguments.(ii) falls out directly from the Agree mechanism. (i) is a purely morphological phenomenon arising as a consequence of the logically possible specifications of local person exponents. Person portmanteaux are analyzed as inclusive exponents in a derived inclusive context. Since such a context can only emerge in local scenarios, (iii) is derived as well. Local scenarios are thus far more systematic than has previously been thought. In general, the paper contributes to the discussion on how morphological theories that rely on discrete slots (DM, PFM) can handle portmanteau morphemes with standard vocabulary insertion and without additional mechanisms like fusion, head movement or spell-out of non-terminals. Finally, I present an empirical argument against taking person portmanteaux to result from the spell-out of non-terminals.",0

"Word-stress location in English has been discussed in terms of extrametricality in rule-based phonology (Liberman and Prince 1977, Hayes 1982), or in terms of the NonFinality constraint in Optimal Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993). In this paper, I will investigate the nature of English stress from a
morphosyntactic and typological point of view. I will focus on a process at the interface between phonology and morphosyntax, that is, comparative forms in the languages of the world. In section 2, I will overview the two comparative forms in English, i.e. morphological comparative and periphrastic comparative. Section 3 classifies languages of the world into three types according to their comparative forms. In section 4, I show that this classification corresponds to the word-stress location in the languages. Section 5 is devoted to explaining why word-stress location correlates to the choice of comparative forms.",0
"This paper proposes a parameter hierarchy to derive all and only the various clausal alignments attested in natural languages (accusative, split-S, morphologically ergative, tripartite, syntactically ergative high and low absolutive). These alignments are derived from five dependent parameters which, it is argued, also serve to derive a number of otherwise mysterious universal implications, such as the ban on split-S syntactically ergative languages. Rather than being prespecified in Universal Grammar, it is proposed that the parameter hierarchy in question is structured by the pressure for convergence: ordering the relevant parameters in any other way makes possible non-convergent derivations. As such, the parameter hierarchy provides not only a characterisation of which alignments are attested in natural language but also the beginnings of an explanation as to why we find these alignments and no others.",0
"Roberts and Roussou (2003) argue that the cross-linguistic distribution of grammaticalization is due to its ""simplification"", and the grammaticalization of case-markers displays it since there is a loss of ""Agree"" relations. Synchronic ""simplicity"" explains diachronic trends, and formalism and functionalism are not mutually exclusive.",0
"Roberts and Roussou (2003) and van Gelderen (2011) analyse grammaticalization in Minimalism and argue that it involves 'structural simplification', which explains its cross-linguistic distribution. Simpson and Wu (2002) analyse 'lateral' grammaticalization, also within Minimalism. Vincent and Borjars (V & B) (2010) argue that the latter is problematic for R & R and van Gelderen's hypotheses, since it does not display an 'upward shift of features', yet I argue in this paper that it actually fits into their definitions of 'structural simplification' since Agree relations are lost in the process. Furthermore, the lack of 'upward shift of features' in 'lateral' grammaticalization correlates with the empirical differences, namely 'phonological weakening', 'univerbation' and 'semantic bleaching', all of which occur in grammaticalization but not in 'lateral' grammaticalization. Finally, V & B (2010) argue that formalism and functionalism are not mutually exclusive, which can be verified by examining the cross-linguistic examples of both grammaticalization and 'lateral' grammaticalization, since while they all undergo 'structural simplification', their 'cues' are also strikingly similar.",0
"Roberts and Roussou (2003) analyse grammaticalization within Minimalism, and Ledgeway (2011a, 2011b) deals with grammaticalization in Latin/Romance, also within Minimalism. Neither of them analyses the grammaticalization of KPs (case-markers) and so this is the theme of this paper. The grammaticalization of two very important Latin/Romance KPs (de marking genitive, ad marking dative) indeed conforms to both Robert & Roussou's and Ledgeway's hypotheses, since they originate from Latin PPs (de denoting separation, ad denoting direction), and within X'-theory complements (e.g. KPs) are 'simpler' than adjuncts (e.g. PPs) in that the former require fewer feature place-holders than the latter (Robert & Roussou (2003:106)), and so by Roberts & Roussou's (2003:200-201) 'structural simplification' (reduction of 'feature syncretisms') PPs are grammaticalized as KPs. Robert & Roussou's 'structural simplification' assumes configurationality and can only occur in configurational syntax, and so configurationality is a prerequisite for grammaticalization in Minimalism, which conforms to Ledgeway's argument (2011a:405-434)) that the key syntactic change from Latin to Romance is the rise of configurationality, which gives rise to functional categories in Romance (Ledgeway (2011a:409)). Finally, as configurationality is a controversial notion, alternative scenarios are considered in the appendix where configurationality no longer has explanatory value, and 're-analysis' is argued to be the key to understanding grammaticalization, since it is in itself sufficient to explain grammaticalization, with or without configurationality.  

Simpson and Wu (2002) and Wu's (2004) 'lateral grammaticalization' is a Minimalist analysis of Chinese de, which has been re-analysed from a determiner (D) to a verbal suffix (T). Roberts and Roussou (2003) and van Gelderen (2011) deal with grammaticalization within Minimalism, though neither take 'lateral grammaticalization' into account (Vincent and Borjars (2010:293)). A comparison between these accounts reveals that Roberts and Roussou's (2003) and van Gelderen's (2011) 'feature economy' also accounts for the cross-linguistic distribution of 'lateral grammaticalization', which is the main theoretical thrust of their accounts (Roberts and Roussou (2003:2-7), van Gelderen (2011:4-17)). However, the lack of 'upward feature analysis' (Roberts and Roussou (2003:200)) in 'lateral grammaticalization' sets it formally apart from grammaticalization, and this ties in empirically with the lack of 'phonological weakening', 'univerbation' and 'semantic bleaching' in 'lateral grammaticalization' when these are the diagnostic traits of grammaticalization (Campbell (2001), Roberts and Roussou (2003:224-232)). All this entails some significant revisions to Minimalism as a model for grammaticalization and 'lateral grammaticalization', the former of which involves an upward shift of features while the latter involves a re-analysis of features from pragmatics.",1
"Barbiers (2008: 2) shows that in syntactic doubling, a constituent (i.e. morphosyntactic feature, morpheme, word, or phrase) is expressed two or more times within a clause without contributing to the semantic interpretation of that clause. Further, the syntactic doubling phenomena is claimed to be a central property of syntax as the result of interaction between syntactic principles and extra syntactic domains. 
This paper aims to address the syntactic dependency between INDEX, classificatory morheme and verb agreement. It argues that feature doubling between INDEX, classificatory morpheme and 'verb agreement' in Indian Sign Language (ISL) are the instances of configurational property, and the variations arise due to the realisation of different features within the configuration. Further, the paper argues that these syntactic properties are driven by the interface requirement that forces key properties of grammar to be visible following Wilbur (2003).",0
"We present and analyse a set of interface phenomena showing important correlations between certain phonological regularities on the one hand and a set of syntactic and semantic properties of the respective expressions on the other. Serbo-Croatian deadjectival nominalizations typically exhibit two different prosodic patterns: 1) prosody faithful to the base i.e. surface prosody of the lexical adjective (e.g. Ispraavnoost 'correctness', derived from Ispraavan 'correct'), 2) a rising span over a long closed penultimate syllable and the syllable following it (e.g. isprAAvnOOst 'correctness'). We formulate a generalization where, all things being equal, nominalised predicational structures correspond to (1), while nominalised stems correspond to (2). The paper provides a formal model of the syntactic and semantic as well as the phonological reality of these nominalisations, and an attempt at explaining these facts.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel test for diagnosing head movement across languages, based on the availability of X-stranding XP-ellipsis. As we argue, X-stranding XP-ellipsis phenomena should exist in languages where XP-ellipsis and X-movement out of XP are both available (as is the case in V-stranding VP-ellipsis in Hebrew or Portuguese, see Goldberg 2005 and references cited there). This has the effect that if a language has XP-ellipsis but lacks X-stranding XP-ellipsis, X-movement out of XP must be lacking in the language. We show the application of this test in the nominal domain, for the particular case of Spanish, one of the languages for which N-raising out of the NP has been proposed in the literature (Bosque and Picallo 1996). Spanish indeed has productive instances of NP-ellipsis, but lacks N-stranding NP-ellipsis. Carefully ruling out other reasons for the lack of N-standing NP-ellipsis, the paper shows that it can only be due to the lack of N-movement out of NP.",1
"Subscribing to the widely held view among linguists that human language provides a window on the human mind, the present paper attempts to establish a connection between grammatical structures and the organization of human memory by looking at a set of temporal markers that appear in realis attributive clauses in Korean, namely, ""-(u)n"", ""-nu-n"", and ""-te-n"". The central claim will be that the behavior of these three markers showcases how human language may encode 'semantic memory' and 'episodic memory' in the sense of Tulving (1972, 1983, 2002, 2005). The analysis proposed here provides indirect support for differentiating between semantic memory and episodic memory as well as dividing memory systems into sub-types. Additionally, the semantic properties of the Korean attributive clause markers uncovered here advances our understanding of the intricate relations that hold between grammatical categories that are known as Tense, Aspect, Mood, and Evidentiality (or TAME) in the linguistics literature.",0
"This paper examines the evolution of two separate but interrelated aspects of the grammar of Sinhala, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the island nation of Sri Lanka (the former Ceylon): the distribution of the Question-particle ""da"" and the formation of relatives clauses in the history of Sinhala. I also examine the structure of relative clauses and the distribution of Question-particles in genetically-unrelated but geographically-proximate Dravidian. The possible role of language contact in the evolution of certain Sinhala grammatical structures---including the employment of the particle ""da""---which have no parallels in other Indo-Aryan languages---is also considered.",0
"In this article we provide empirical evidence against a Lexicalist view on morphology (Chomsky 1970, Lapointe 1980, DiSciullo & Williams 1987 amongst many others). More specifically, we distinguish between three types of ANN compounds in Dutch. We show that the structural properties of these types do not show a one-to-one mapping with lexical properties, such as having a listed or even idiomatic meaning. On the basis of this, we argue that conclusions on the structure of certain morphologically complex word-forms should be based on structural properties and not on lexical properties such as idiomaticity or being lexicalized (pace Ackema & Neeleman 2004 on Dutch ANN compounds). We further argue that there are no empirical grounds to postulate a separate morphological module. All ANN compounds in Dutch are built in syntax. Structural differences follow from the level of merge: what we traditionally call morphology is syntax below the functional domain.",1

"In Czech nominal declension Nsg and Gpl morphemes have zero allomorphs which are traditionally assumed to have the same phonology. For example, Halle & Nevins (2009) claim that both zeros are underlyingly yers which, being word final, are deleted during the phonological computation. However, on the basis of contrasting behavior of consonant clusters with final liquids, I argue that these case markers have different lexical representations: the Gpl zero is a yer, but the Nsg zero has no underlying structure at all.",0
"In this thesis, I argue that suffixal and verbal status of a grammatical object can be predicted from its syntactic position within the framework of the Mirror Theoretic syntax of Brody (2003). 

I first show that in Turkish there is a constraint that dictates that the 
morpheme syntactically right above a verbal item be suffixed to this verbal item, which I dub V-X. I argue that X-bar Theory is not well-suited to capture this observation of suffixhood as a syntax-related phenomenon. I show that, in an antilexicalist implementation, the Mirror Theory of Brody (2003) can capture V-X as a reflex of syntax, relating it to the inability of verbal items to show phrasal behavior. I argue that this follows from the fact that verbal items can only occupy a complement position (one of the two logically possible positions) in Mirror Theoretic syntax. I present evidence from Basque, Japanese, Hindi and English to show that V-X is a valid constraint in these languages and that this is correlated with the fact that verbal items cannot show phrasal behavior in these languages.  

I, then, argue that, in direct opposition to verbal items, two non-verbal items 
(nouns and non-verbal participles) always show phrasal behavior in Turkish. I 
present evidence from earlier works, indicating that the inflection on non-verbal items is always phrasal (and not suffixal) and that head-movement analysis of noun incorporation in line with Baker (1988) is not the right analysis for Turkish. With this, I argue that non-verbal items can only occupy the other position (i.e. the specifier position) in Mirror Theoretic syntax. I present further evidence from Basque, Japanese, Hindi and English, indicating that the claim that the non-verbal elements are always phrasal objects has cross-linguistic validity. I show that, with a few exceptions, in these languages, too, nominal inflection is phrasal inflection and that head-movement of bare objects is not the right analysis in the context of noun incorporation.  

Lastly, I outline a theory of lexical features where the [+/- verbal] and [+/- 
suffix] features are replaced by features that indicate what syntactic position an object may occupy in Mirror Theoretic syntax.",0
"While what little ice cut by extant arguments for the idea that particle verbs are complex heads (compounds, morphological objects) is largely theory-internal, I defend this view with new arguments, focussing largely on English. My arguments focus on nominalization, synthetic compounding and quotative inversion constructions involving particles. The arguments work independently of whether one endorses a lexicalist or syntactic view of word formation phenomena.",0
"A common property of many Mayan languages is a change to transitive verb morphology when the subject has been extracted, known as Agent Focus (AF) (Aissen, 1999; Stiebels, 2006; Norcliffe, 2009; Coon et al., 2011, a.o.). AF is traditionally described as obligatory whenever the subject (ergative argument) is A'-extracted. In this paper I will discuss the morphological realization of AF in Kaqchikel. I argue that the realization of AF in Kaqchikel must be governed by a morphological process which is independent of the syntax of AF. Specifically, I argue that AF morphology is the realization of an abstract [AF] feature which spreads downwards within a certain domain, following Bjorkman's (ms) feature-spreading approach to Affix Hopping-type verbal morphology.",0
"This is a brief precis of A Syntax of Substance (MIT Press, 2013), which sketches the main ideas and conclusions of the book. The core idea is that there are no functional heads qua lexical items and that labeling of structure is hence strictly separated from building of structure and is given exocentrically. The consequence of this idea in the system I develop is that there is no roll-up movement, and that there are no arguments in complement positions. The syntax and semantics of ultra-nominal relational nouns is used as a case study for these ideas.",0
"[English abstract of the paper, which is written in Romanian] Building on previous work on parameterisation in the minimalist framework and on Gabi Danon's (2010) insight that there exists a definiteness parameter, we claim that this parameter manifests itself in the syntax of the Romanian DP. We discuss several structures which show that the definiteness feature is active for Agree (definiteness agreements; the genitive marker al), and we employ data from the history of Romanian to show that the definite article is projected as a suffix on the noun. At the same time, we establish the position of the definiteness parameter in the hierarchical model built by Ian Roberts (2012a, 2012b) (i.e. it is a mesoparameter), and argue that the data analysed here can be taken as evidence for the validity of the Borer–Chomsky Conjecture.",0
"In a recent manuscript (""There is Only One Way to Agree""; http://ling.auf.net/lingBuzz/001435), Zeijlstra (2012) argues that the theory of agreement should be revised so that valuation uniformly flows downward, such that the element that contributes the value (e.g. in the case of predicate-argument agreement in phi-features, the nominal) is required to c-command the element that receives its value derivatively (e.g. the verb or tense/aspect/mood marker) -- rather than the other way around, as standardly assumed.

In this short reply, I wish to demonstrate that Zeijlstra's proposal is untenable as a theory of agreement proper (i.e., as an account of the morpho-phonologically overt co-variance in phi-features between a finite verb or a tense/aspect/mood marker and a nominal argument).

I survey two empirical domains, from Tsez and Basque, demonstrating this point; I then briefly discuss the consequences of these facts for the empirical domains that Zeijlstra examines.",0
"English vocabulary is divided: a Germanic core inherited from Germanic sources and a second vocabulary borrowed from the Romance family and Classical Greek. Several synchronic criteria divide the two vocabularies. 
The primary vocabulary still conforms to the general Proto-Germanic rule; stress can only fall on a morpheme's first syllable. In contrast, its secondary vocabulary stress patterns follow Chomsky and Halle's (1968) ""Main stress rule"", often referred to as the ""Romance stress rule."" There are several correlations between this stress-based division and morpho-syntactic properties; secondary vocabulary always exhibits regular productive inflection and analytic grading of adjectives.
This study focuses especially on syntactic differences: only primary vocabulary verbs freely combine with post-verbal particles of direction, and allow double objects with no preposition. These general properties seem hard to express in lexical terms. Nonetheless, a device proposed here seems to capture both these English-particular characteristics: Secondary vocabulary verbs do not lexically select complements whose heads have the feature +DIRECTION. Though at first glance this condition seems too strong, the essay argues that this restriction can stand when indirect objects are structurally properly analyzed.",0
"The present article proposes an account of NPN forms in which these are words, some of them being small clauses, others coordinate nouns. This work shows that there are two classes of NPN forms, depending on whether the head of the construction is P (face to face) or N (student after student). One important theoretical point raised by such constructs is that they are ternary structures and thus seem to contradict Kayne's (1984) universal condition on binary branching. I will claim that, if Kayne's principle is cognitive in nature, then these ternary constructions are indeed possible, but only because there is one specific way for the brain to allow for their formation: symmetry.",0
"This paper investigates the acquisition of English multiple interrogatives such
as Who did what? by advanced learners of English whose first language is Indonesian. The
underlying functional feature of multiple interrogatives is multiple focus features, which
are not available in Indonesian. Unlike English, there is no equivalent structure of multiple
interrogatives in Indonesian since wh-questions in this language are instantiations of unique
focus constructions. Acceptability judgment tasks were administered on four wh-pairings: whowhen,
who-where, what-when, and what-where. The first task was in the form of questions
with a pair-list answer and single answer, whereas the second was in the form of questions
within the contexts. Conjoined interrogatives were also added into the tasks in order to observe
the L1 transfer. The results clearly demonstrate that overall advanced learners of English were
significantly different from the English native speakers in their ratings of acceptability of
multiple interrogatives. However, the statistical data of each wh-phrase pairing demonstrates
that L2 learners performed like native controls in their ratings of most of the pairings. These
findings suggest that the present study lends partial support to Full Transfer/Full Access
Hypothesis and No Parameter Resetting Hypothesis.",1
"Russian normally does not have secondary stress, but it is variably realized in compounds. We examined the factors that contribute to secondary stress realization in a rating study, where listeners were asked to rate compounds pronounced without secondary stress and with secondary stress in various locations. We refine some generalizations from impressionistic descriptions: in compounds whose left-hand stems have mobile lexical stress, acceptability of secondary stress decreases with token frequency of the compound, and acceptability of pronunciations without stress increases with frequency. Ratings improve as distance between stresses increases, and this effect is gradient rather than categorical. We also identify new generalizations about secondary stress that relates to the properties of the left-hand stem. First, we identify a faithfulness effect: stress realization is optional on lexically stressed stems, but stress movement is strongly penalized. Second, we identify a sonority sequencing effect: secondary stress is not tolerated well on linker vowels in compounds, but acceptability improves significantly when the linker is the only vowel in a stem with a falling sonority cluster. Thus, the stress system distinguishes clusters with falling sonority from other types.",1
"The -st morpheme in Icelandic resembles Romance and Slavic reflexive clitics and some Germanic simplex reflexives in that it is associated with a number of different uses on various verbs; this includes, among other uses, a middle/anticausative, a reciprocal, and a reflexive use. The reflexive use of -st is, however, much more restricted than that of typical reflexive clitics. In this article, I discuss in detail one particular class of reflexive -st verb, which I will refer to as the 'figure reflexive'. With figure reflexive constructions, the subject bears an external agentive θ-role and is also understood as a 'figure' with respect to a spatial 'ground', in the sense of Talmy (1985). I discuss two questions that reflexive -st verbs raise for a syntactic view of argument structure: what is the relationship between anticausatives and reflexives, and where does lexical idiosyncrasy arise? For the first question, I propose to analyze -st as an argument expletive, which in figure reflexive constructions is merged in SpecpP (cf. Svenonius 2003, 2007), but in anticausatives is merged in SpecVoiceP. Only in the former case can the θ-role survive in semantics, which is argued to derive from the fact that VoiceP dominates pP, and not the other way around. For the second question, I argue that there are two separate issues: the first is the syntactic distribution of -st (which limits the kinds of reflexive -st verbs that can exist) and the second is the integration of roots into abstract event structure. This analysis supports a model of grammar where the semantics interprets the syntax, but the syntax operates autonomously from semantics: interpretation is determined 'late', just like phonological forms are.",0
"The paper argues that Czech numerals spell out a phrasal projection that has a noun at the bottom. I argue that this proposal sheds light on three aspects of their peculiar syntax: (i) the case that we find on the counted noun (ii) the ambiguity between a numerical and nominal syntax (for some of them), and (iii) the fact that they may move across the demonstrative (with a partitive effect).",0
"The morphological analysis of paradigms generally proposes a distinction between accidental and systematic homophony. No specific assumptions are usually made about the distribution of accidental homophony, though. Therefore current assumptions cannot prove satisfactorily what should be regarded as systematic in morphology. We propose that accidental homophony should be assumed to be a random event in the statistical sense with a constant probability across languages and across paradigms. This approach allows us to assign a likelihood to any actual typological distribution of syncretism given a morphological analysis. And by computing such likelihoods for a range of analyses, we can then apply maximum likelihood analysis to determine the best analyses. Hence, the statistical foundation allows us to empirically test morphological analyses that include accidental syncretism. In this paper, we primarily introduce the conceptual and mathematical foundations of a statistical modeling technique, Syncretism Distribution Modeling, and show how it overcomes the problem of accidental homophony. In addition, we apply the technique to show that person paradigms must involve both accidental homophony and systematic syncretism.",0
"The Alemannic dialects spoken in Switzerland and in south-western Germany 
are structurally very similar. This seems to extend to the motion verb construction where the motion verb is obligatorily followed by an element gi/go followed by an infinitive. Upon closer inspection, however, intriguing asymmetries emerge. We account for these differences by treating gi/go as belonging to different syntactic categories. This synchronic difference in categorization can be related to different historical developments, as proposed by Lötscher (1993): both elements go back to the preposition gen 'towards' and developed into a functional head with purpose/goal semantics that combines with a non-finite verbal projection. We will show that while gi in Bodensee-Alemannic still heads this functional projection, go in Swiss German has been reanalyzed as a verbal element and is now integrated into the Verb Raising and Verb Projection Raising system.",0
"This paper considers the genesis of case markers (K(case)), a functional category hitherto unanalysed in formal (Minimalist) analyses of grammaticalization (Roberts and Roussou (2003), van Gelderen (2004, 2011)), and new proposals are made not only with regards to their diachronic genesis but also to their synchronic and typological status in Case theory.",0
"This thesis focuses on nominalization of serial verb constructions (SVCs) in the Akan language. The study develops a relevant typology of serial verb nominalization on the basis of semantic integration and lexicalization using a prototype theory (PT) framework. The three degrees of semantic integration for serial verbs in Akan are Full Lexicalized-Integrated Serial Verb Constructions (FL-ISVCs), Partial Lexicalized-Integrated Serial Verb Constructions (PL-ISVCs) and Clause Chaining Serial Constructions (CCSCs). Each type of SVC is analyzed on the basis of how it is nominalized, the degree to which nominalization occurs and whether nominalization can occur at all. Various corpuses were consulted in three major literary dialects of Akan: Asante Twi, Fante and Akuapem Twi. Further, native speakers of each of these dialects were consulted to ascertain the goodness of various attested serial verb nominals (SVNs) in Akan.
Because Full Lexicalized-Integrated Serial Verb Constructions behave as lexicalized idioms, four criteria of idiomaticity are applied to them including collocability, familiarity, flexibility and compositionality (Barkema 1996). The results from the study show that over 98% of all FL-ISVCs identified have nominal counterparts while less than 3% of all PL-ISVCs identified have nominal counterparts. CCSCs seem to nominalize haphazardly as frozen sentences, proverbs, idioms and figures of speech which primarily function as denotata and designata. While there was some degree of interdialectal variability with regard to individual SVNs, the pattern of nominalization behavior on the basis of degrees of semantic integration and lexicalization remained consistent across dialects.",0
"This dissertation investigates preposition stranding observed in Colloquial Welsh using a generative grammar approach.
Welsh traditionally disallows P-stranding. In Literary Welsh, prepositional relatives require a resumptive pronoun which is licensed by the rich agreement of P, and wh-questions require pied-piping of the entire PP. However, the use of uninflected stranded preposition can be found colloquially, both in relatives and wh-questions.
This dissertation proposes an account of the different syntactic behaviour between the two varieties, based on the notion of PF feature checking proposed by Ackema and Neeleman (2004). I claim that if PF checking takes place between a P head and its DP complement, the DP will be unable to move out of the complement position. This means that P-stranding is impossible. On the other hand, if PF checking does not hold between P and its complement, P-stranding is possible.",0
"We report on a robust symmetry between the Polish and the Japanese sequence of syntactic
projections in what superficially looks like different domains, namely verbal prefixes (Polish)
and multiple verbs (Japanese). This paralellism strongly supports the thesis about the fine-grained
sequence of positions in syntax, namely that there exists the functional sequence of
syntactic heads (fseq) which is invariantly ordered by UG (e.g. Cinque (1999)) and the
surface differences among particular langauges in the order of elements that instantiate this
fseq result solely from movement (not from the variation in fseq itself).",1
"We propose a revision to the Elsewhere Principle, in which contextual specification within the environment of a vocabulary entry trumps the inherent morphosyntactic specification borne by the vocabulary entry itself in cases of competition. Application of this principle accounts for contextual neutralization, a phenomenon that we exemplify with two case studies. One is Basque proclitic realization, in which the case of a pronominal clitic is neutralized according to its linearized position. The second is the realization of Bulgarian definite articles, which neutralize gender distinctions depending on the phonology of the host noun to their left. In understanding this latter pattern, we offer an analysis of the facts presented in Harizanov & Gribanova 2011, in which these definite articles appear to depend on phonology alone when found in conjunction structures with coordinated adjectives. We argue that the latter phenomenon reflects a modularization of Agree into two-steps: a syntactic Agree-Link, and a postsyntactic Agree-Copy, following much recent work (e.g. Bhatt & Walkow, to appear). Lowering of the postposed determiner is interleaved between these two operations, thereby feeding a stage of Agree-Copy in which the closest c-commanding goal is chosen as a value-source. The proposed revisions to the theory of Distributed Morphology within the paper open new roads of inquiry for understanding phenomena often posed as a challenge to phonology-free syntax, as recently discussed in Svenonius (2012).",1
"The generalization that V-to-I movement is conditioned by rich subject agreement on the finite verb, generally referred to as the Rich Agreement Hypothesis, has since the 1980s functioned as an indication for a tight connection between syntax and morphology. In recent years, the Rich Agreement Hypothesis received a lot of bad press, both on empirical and theoretical grounds. In this article, we demonstrate that all the empirical arguments against this hypothesis are seriously flawed and that it therefore must be rehabilitated in its strongest form. Moreover, we argue that the correlation between syntax and morphology is not direct (morphology does not drive syntax) but results from acquisition: only if language learners are confronted with particular morphological contrasts do they postulate the presence of corresponding formal features that in turn drive syntactic operations. More concretely, we demonstrate that only if language learners can infer that argumenthood is grammaticalized in their target language are they able to postulate a particular functional projection in the extended vP to which the finite verb must move. Finally, we show that this explanation of the Rich Agreement Hypothesis makes correct predictions with respect to language variation, change and acquisition.",0
"In this paper, which we conceive of as an extension of Krivochen (2011b), we will analyze the ultimate motivations of internal merge, as part of our attempt to develop a ""Radical Theory for the Minimalist Program"". External Merge and Transfer have already been analyzed beyond explanatory adequacy in our previous paper (see Chomsky, 2001). Going Beyond Explanatory Adequacy is a notion we will resignify here as aiming to an understanding of the ultimate computational-biological motivations of phenomena, in terms of interface requirements in the context of a massively modular mind-brain (the ""third factor"" in Chomsky, 2005b). We would like to thank Cedric Boeckx, Phoevos Panagiotidis, Antonio Fábregas, Michal Starke (specially regarding Nanosyntax issues), David Adger, Anna Maria Di Sciullo and Chris Collins for comments and objections to our theory that helped greatly in the delevopment of this paper.

"This paper presents a new DP analysis of classifier languages. The motivation for this analysis comes from the classifier-modifier construction (CMC) in Thai, in which a predicative modifier can license a bare classifier, resulting in a definite singular interpretation. I argue that the definite readings are due to a null choice-functional determiner (Reinhart 1997, Winter 1997), which takes the modifier as its complement (Kayne 1994). I propose that the modifier licenses the bare classifier, otherwise prohibited, because head raising relative clause structures bleed the environment for a D-Clf-N span to be realized as a bare noun (Brody 2000, Svenonius 2012, a.o.). I argue that this coalescence-based account of definite noun phrases, specifically definite bare nouns, is an improvement on accounts based on head movement (Cheng and Sybesma 1999) or semantic type-shifting (Chierchia 1998). This analysis correctly derives the generalization that languages allowing definite bare classifiers mostly prohibit definite bare nouns, captures Chierchia's nominal typology without resorting to semantic variation, and provides a novel explanation for the apparent optionality of functional morphology in analytic languages.

"Simpson and Wu (2002) and Wu's (2004) 'lateral grammaticalization' is a Minimalist analysis of Chinese de, which has been re-analysed from a determiner (D) to a verbal suffix (T). Roberts and Roussou (2003) and van Gelderen (2011) deal with grammaticalization within Minimalism, though neither take 'lateral grammaticalization' into account (Vincent and Borjars (2010:293)). A comparison between these accounts reveals that Roberts and Roussou's (2003) and van Gelderen's (2011) 'feature economy' also accounts for the cross-linguistic distribution of 'lateral grammaticalization', which is the main theoretical thrust of their accounts (Roberts and Roussou (2003:2-7), van Gelderen (2011:4-17)). However, the lack of 'upward feature analysis' (Roberts and Roussou (2003:200)) in 'lateral grammaticalization' sets it formally apart from grammaticalization, and this ties in empirically with the lack of 'phonological weakening', 'univerbation' and 'semantic bleaching' in 'lateral grammaticalization' when these are the diagnostic traits of grammaticalization (Campbell (2001), Roberts and Roussou (2003:224-232)). All this entails some significant revisions to Minimalism as a model for grammaticalization and 'lateral grammaticalization', the former of which involves an upward shift of features while the latter involves a re-analysis of features from pragmatics.",0
"Object agreement is the realization of phi features on v, whereas clitic doubling is often analyzed as the movement of a D head in order to attach to a verb.  In principle, these two phenomena are distinct, but in practice it can be difficult to distinguish them.  In this paper, I take up the issue for the Amharic object marker, a morpheme that covaries with the phi features of an internal argument.  Evidence from its distribution and morphological form indicate that it is a doubled clitic, but it also displays a handful of properties characteristic of agreement.  Building on some of the most recent clitic doubling research, I develop an Agree-based clitic doubling analysis of the object marker that accounts for both its doubled clitic-like and agreement-like properties.  Overall, the paper is a case study in how to distinguish clitic doubling and agreement in a particular language, and an investigation of how to capture the relationship between these two deeply similar phenomena in linguistic theory.",0
"It is well known that referentially defective nominals fall into two broad
categories: pro-forms whose reference seems structurally constrained (local anaphors, OC PRO) and those which are discourse-pragmatically conditioned (logophors, deictic pronouns, indexicals). Nevertheless, a strict binary distinction cannot be maintained because most actually straddle the syntax-discourse divide: e.g. deictic pronouns can be variable-bound, indexicals may be ""shifted"" under certain intensional operators, and logophors and long-distance anaphors often look and behave alike.

The central thesis of this dissertation is that a proper subset of pro-
forms can receive a unified analysis under an enriched grammatical model that posits the syntactic representation of mental and/or spatio-temporal perspective. To this end, I present novel evidence from verbal agreement
triggered under anaphora to show that even so-called ""logophoric"" reference involves an indelible syntactic core. I propose that perspective is featurally represented on a silent pronominal operator in the specifier of a Perspectival  phrase (PerspP) at the phasal-edge of certain CPs, PPs, DPs, and AspPs and may be exploited to yield a unified account of anaphora and agreement patterns triggered under it. Anaphora involves two distinct dependencies: an Agree relationship between the anaphor and the operator in the [Spec, PerspP] of its minimal phase, which is the equivalent of syntactic binding, and a conceptual relationship between the antecedent and this operator, which is the equivalent of non-obligatory control. Thus, all binding is local and syntactic; all antecedence is non-local and (primarily) non-syntactic. I also illustrate that
perspective must be kept conceptually and structurally distinct from the Kaplanian utterance context and the intensional ""context"" responsible for indexical shift.

"In this paper, we will present a morpho­‐syntactic analysis of the class of Italian adverbs signalling bodily

seems reasonable (following e.g. Cinque 1999, 2006a) to argue that they are merged in the Specifier
of a low Manner Projection above the VP, there are many puzzling facts about them that we will try to account for in this paper. We will propose that, akin to CP adverbials (see Gallego 2010), adverbs in –one/i

"In this brief paper, I will show that an account based on the idea of Phrasal Spell-out can elegantly account for some puzzles regarding VN compounds in Romance languages, interpreted here as 'lexicalized modifying clauses'. I will advance the hypothesis of a rebooting mechanism in extended projections as an alternative to the postulation of silent items to account for the ambiguous nature of VN words that can appear either as noun or adjectives/adverbials. With such an approach no compounding rules are involved and we do not need to resort to categorial underpecification to account for the 'VN facts'.",0
"The paper presents evidence concerning the trigger of numeralization
of Polish higher numerals based on diachronic facts pertinent to their development.
We focus on the reasons behind this process and argue that it resulted from
a combination of two historical facts: (i) the development of the category of animacy/
personhood/masculinity, in particular masculine personal, and (ii) its grammaticalization
via the introduction of a new Acc/Gen syncretism into the paradigms of
masculine animate and masculine personal nouns. We propose that the developing
new gender distinction in the plural constituted the trigger for numeralization
of the nominal numerals which shifted from NP to NumP and as lexicalizations
of NumP they began spelling out the gender information it introduced. As a result
of this process, numerals have lost their own nominal properties (-features:
number, gender), and formed a separate category with its own new declension.",0

"One clue to the architecture of the mental lexicon comes from frequency effects in lexical decision tasks. While the widely-reported evidence for base frequency effects suggests that the roots posited by morphologists are psychologically real, recent work downplays the role of bases in favor of the hypothesis that whole words may be stored in memory; some studies (e.g., Sereno & Jongman 1997) deny base frequency effects altogether. In this study, we investigate whole word frequency effects in English regularly inflected words. We model a very large database of visual lexical decision latencies at the trial level with mixed effects regression, using residualization to control for confounding predictors of reaction time. We conclude that whole word frequency effects we observe do not argue in favor of whole word storage; in fact, they are inconsistent with the predictions of dual-route processing models.",1
"This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the morphosyntax of transitive constructions
in Tagalog focussing, specifically, on the relationship between specificity and the morphosyntactic
strategies by which theme arguments are realized. Contrary to what previous studies have
claimed, I show that specific noun phrases are attested as direct objects of active clause in Tagalog.
An exception to this is pronoun and proper name themes, which must either be oblique
marked to function as a direct object or be realized as a subject. Developing upon analyses in
Rackowski (2002) and Rackowski & Richards (2005), I propose that the differential behavior
of specific themes (pronoun/proper names on the one hand vs. non-pronoun/proper name specific
themes on the other) follows from a clausal architecture in which there are at least two VP
external positions to which specific themes must raise--a relatively high position for pronoun
and proper name themes, and a position intermediate between vP and VP for all other specific
themes. The distribution of syntactic positions available for the theme argument is claimed to
follow from a proposal in Merchant (2006), pre-figured in Jelinek (1993) and in related work,
that relational hierarchies of the type familiar from typological research--in particular, the definiteness
hierarchy-are directly encoded in the phrase structure.",0
"In this article I argue that the Hebrew tri-consonantal root spells out the composite Syntactic Object formed by Merge of an elementary CVC root and one or more functional heads. I also present five novel rules that allow us to find the CVC root for many Hebrew words. These five formal rules make no use of informal semantic intuitions, but rather are precise and algorithmic. The striking support for this proposal derives from the simple fact that these five rules are all in complete agreement with each other.",0
"The 2nd person singular pronoun du 'thou' has been replaced by new
pronouns gij/jij/jii 'you' in many Dutch dialects.  In this study we trace a purely syntactic trigger for this change. Using dialect geographic tools of the GTRP dialect database, we found a significant correlation between the loss of du and the rise of double present tense paradigms (direct and inverse). By defining two types of Verb Second, C-type V2 (Den Besten) and C/T-type V2 (Zwart), we
show that a transition between those types predicts the loss of position-dependent
spelled out pronouns such as du. The factor that blocks Den
Besten-type V2 structures in clauses with [2] in Dutch dialects is the clausetyping property of the feature [2], which generate a violation that is similar to the that-trace violations with the [WH] feature.",0
"This article is part of a book currently in preparation. It is the first of four chapters which set out our theory about how 'movement' in natural language should be treated in a Minimalist grammar where Merge, and hence underlying order, is primarily driven by LF demands. This chapter and the next are sisters, accounting for 'head movement' in this chapter and 'phrasal displacement' in the next. Here, we investigate the requirements for 'head movement', using the heads and affixes of the clausal spine as initial data. We argue that head movement is obtained by selective Spell Out of terminals obtained within narrow syntax solely by 'Agree'. We argue for an 'Agree' system using simple or paired morphosyntactic features associated with heads in the lexicon, regulated entirely by Merge with unification. We show that Agree need not be specified as 'upward' or 'downward', nor is c-command required. Intervention effects fall out from the Merge rules. Relevant lexical entries including morphosyntactic features are given for verbs, auxiliaries, modals, negations, and dummies.",1
"In this paper we report on the results of five experiments documenting the existence of three distinct grammars of conjunct agreement in Slovenian, found both within and across individuals: agreement with the highest conjunct, agreement with the closest conjunct, or agreement with the Boolean Phrase itself.

Finally, we offer the suggestion that the presence of intra- individual variation arises due to ambiguous properties of the primary linguistic data.",0
"I raise a number of issues here for especially the usage based variants of Construction Grammar
defended by Goldberg, Tomasello and others. I point out that proponents of such varieties of Construction
Grammar assume massive amounts of innate constraints on both learning mechanisms
and on cognitive representations, many of which are specific to those capacities. They just take
language to be unlike other cognitive capacities in that it does not involve such constraints. There
is no a priori argument for this position. I also show that no empirical argument can be made on the
basis of claims that semantics attaches to structures rather than words, given that both Construction
Grammar and Generative Grammar allow this. Further, the evidence we have about language conflicts
with the idea that it is unlike other cognitive capacities in having no innate domain-specific
constraints. The facts suggest the need for a theory of structure, and the usage-based varieties of construction grammar provide no such thing.",0
"I propose a novel syntactic analysis of conflation based on Zwart's (2009, 2011) layered-derivation theory and De Belder & van Craenenbroeck's (2011) theory of roots: in conflation constructions the verb corresponds to a whole vP which, nevertheless, acts as a head. I explore how the theory explains the cross-linguistic variation in the availability of conflation. Finally, I show that atransitivity -the fact that the verb in conflation constructions cannot link any argument- is easily accommodated within the theory.",0

"The choice of theme vowels in Spanish nouns and adjectives can be predicted neither from the phonological shape of roots nor from syntactic features like gender. However, this state of affairs does not require the postulation of inflectional class features. The alternative is for the Spanish lexicon to store stems with their theme vowels, instead of roots annotated with declension diacritics; default generalizations over the lexical entries of stems can be expressed by means of lexical redundancy rules. The hypothesis of stem storage is compatible with the failure of Spanish theme vowels to surface in certain environments: this is demonstrably caused by an entirely general and regular phonological process deleting unaccented stem-final vowels before suffixes beginning with another vowel. Stem storage receives further support from psycholinguistic data from recognition latencies. Additional new evidence comes from cyclic locality conditions on allomorph selection, as shown by an analysis of the well-known stress-driven alternation displayed by items like [kont-á-ɾ] 'count.INF' ~ [kwént-a] 'count.3SG'. In derivatives like [N [V kont-a] ðóɾ] 'counter', assuming that diphthongal allomorphy is a property of the root incorrectly predicts that the choice of allomorph will be determined in the first cycle: i.e. *[kwentaðóɾ]. The locality problem vanishes if /kont-a/ and /kwent-a/ are both listed in the lexicon as stem allomorphs. These data show that Stratal Optimality Theory allied to a stem-driven theory of morphology performs better than alternative approaches to allomorphic locality. Root-driven Distributed Morphology is too local: the domains for allomorph selection that it generates are too narrow. Conversely, noncyclic versions of Optimality Theory fail to predict allomorphic locality (even if they can describe its effects) because they endow allomorph selection with unrestricted access to the global environment.",0
"This paper examines the argument-structural potential of non-heads of compounds as we can observe it in constructions like 'travel ban to Cuba', where the PP 'to Cuba' satisfies the goal role of the non-head 'travel'. Different types of such compound-external argument realizations are discussed for German, including genitive DPs as in 'Absturzursache des Flugzeugs' ('crash_cause of the airplane'), and I will argue for a pragmatically anchored analysis, based on conversational maxims à la Grice, for those cases where the argumental PP/DP stands in a thematic relation *only* to the non-head. In contrast, for argumental genitive DPs which thematically relate to *both* the head as well as the non-head, as in 'Designanalyse des Geschirrs' ('design_analysis of the dinnerware'), I will propose a grammatically rooted analysis, which relies on a lexical-semantic operation of functional composition of the head noun predicate ('analysis') and the relational non-head noun ('design'). Thus, here, the genitive DP saturates the argument ""inherited"" to the expression resulting from the functional composition. In conclusion, a lexical-structural projection will be maintained to be present below the word level. I will argue for such an analysis to be compatible with a lexicalist perspective, under the assumption of a model in which morphology and syntax – competing with each other – represent two separate domains of grammar, which, however, share a common generative structure building apparatus.",0
"In this paper I want to discuss the classical Distributed Morphology (DM) analysis of Georgian verbal inflection in Halle & Marantz (1993), taking into account additional data from another South Caucasian language, the Pazar dialect of Laz. I will show that the analysis they proposed fails to treat systematic properties shared by the languages as genuine phenomena, but instead relies on arbitrary and highly specific rules. As a contrast to the DM analysis I present an alternative analysis in a Nanosyntax based framework and show how constituency based realization can derive the data without any manipulation of the structure. I will then go on and argue that a core assumption that dm makes about the morphological realization of syntactic structure - namely the idea that morpho-syntactic features are bundled into morphemes that constitute the locus of vocabulary  insertion - necessitates inelegant restructuring with powerful instruments.",0
"This paper proposes an explanation for a homonymy between gen.sg and nom.pl, attested in a number of languages. The proposal is that the formation of the plural involves a silent noun (GROUP), which requires a genitive case on its complement. I provide independent evidence for such a proposal, focussing on languages where the noun is overt, and the fact that the syncretism is unavailable for pronouns and often also demonstratives. An apparently crazy agreement system in Bayso is explained along similar lines, extending the scope of the proposal beyond syncretism.",0
"This dissertation presents two extensive case studies in the morpho-syntactic structure of American Sign Language (ASL) based on original fieldwork conducted with native, deaf signers.

The first case study focuses on the structure of attributive and predicative POSS possessives. Based on language-internal diagnostics, this study shows that the possessive marker, POSS, functions as a verbal predicate of possession, not as a DP-internal marker of the possessive relation. The structure and interpretation of predicative POSS possessives are reduced to the interaction of the verbal POSS structure with two functional components of the predicative domain: (i) locative structure and (ii) licensing positions of definite objects. Attributive POSS possessives are derived as prenominal reduced relative clause modifiers formed from this underlying predicative structure.

The second case study presented here addresses the structural uniformity and semantic ambiguity of two classes of deverbal nominals formed via reduplication in ASL: concrete object-denoting nominals and result-denoting nominals. Based on a morpho-semantic decomposition of verbal structure that is transparent in the surface form of verbal predicates in ASL, it is shown that nominalization via reduplication targets the lowest constituent of the verbal structure (VP-Res). Nominalization of VP-Res yields the class of result-denoting nominals, while concrete object-denoting nominals are derived as relative clause structures headed by a nominal argument that is introduced by the classifier structure present in the relevant verbal forms.",0
"This paper seeks to illustrate the advantages of not taking phonological words to be building blocks for compositional semantics. It pursues the same approach as Szabolcsi, Whang, and Zu (2012), but focuses on a very different problem.  Following Bobaljik (2012), it derives the so-called relative readings of amount superlatives in two steps, [[[d-many] comparative] superlative]. The existence of two comparative constructions is revealed, involving MORE vs. THE MORE. Each serves as the basis for a different superlative construction, explaining the conflicting intuitions about superlatives in the literature, as well as puzzles relating to the definite article in superlatives.",0
"Morphology, we argue, may be reduced entirely to the function that spells out the syntactic tree by choosing and inserting phonologically contentful lexical items. Assuming late insertion and spans, we make use of several devices which have been argued for elsewhere in different ways: contextual allomorphy, affixation of autosegments and/or featurally deficient root nodes, and the affixation of prosodic units, figure centrally. Non-concatenative effects arise from (i) the way the phonology deals with roots/stems and affixes that are deficient segmentally (they consist solely of prosodic information) or featurally (they are composed of underspecified root nodes), and (ii) the way the phonology handles affixes whose relation to higher level prosodic units such as the word and phrase is prespecified. We propose that these devices taken together are sufficient to account for the panoply of non-concatenative effects.

"This study examines the historical development of light verbs in Indo-Aryan. I investigate the origins of the modern Indo-Aryan compound verb construction, and compare this construction with other light verb constructions in Indo-Aryan. Examination of the antecedents of the Indo-Aryan compound verb construction alongside other Indo-Aryan light verb constructions, combined with analysis of lexical and morphosyntactic differences between the compound verb systems of two Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi and Nepali), demonstrate that light verbs are not a stable or unchanging part of grammar, but rather undergo a variety of changes, including reanalysis as tense/aspect auxiliaries.",0
"In this paper we investigate V-V incorporation in agglutinating SOV languages as a case of complex predicates involving affixal light verbs that attach to the verbal root they take as complements. The Uto-Aztecan language Hiaki offers excellent evidence of such a phenomenon. We argue that all affixal verb combinations in this language involve VP complementation in support of Wurmbrand's (2007) analysis of complex predicates and that they are syntactically transparent in the sense of Wurmbrand (2001). That is, they invariably take vP phases (in the sense of Legate 2003) as their complements, which explains both the syntactic and morphological characteristics of the complement clause. These V-V combinations are contrasted with opacity-inducing (CP embedding) complement clauses available in this language, incidentally involving the heavy version of some verbs appearing in the V-V constructions. Finally, we offer evidence that all suffixes participating in complex predicates in Hiaki are affixal light verbs, as defined in Butt (1993), and not auxiliaries or serial verbs, shedding more light on the distinction among these classes.",0
"As ergativity has played an increasingly prominent role in discussions of case and agreement, a number of formal tools have been developed to represent the differences between ergative and accusative alignment systems. Overwhelmingly, these formal analyses fail to address the fact - often noted in the typological literature - that while many languages are consistently accusative, very few appear to be consistently ergative; rather, ergative systems are characterized by ""splits"". This paper surveys the existing empirical and theoretical work on split ergativity and proposes that split ergativity is epiphenomenal, and that the factors which trigger the appearance of splits are not limited to ergative systems in the first place.



In both aspectual and NP-type splits, we argue, the split is the result of a bifurcation of the clause into two distinct case/agreement domains; this bifurcation results in the subject being, in structural terms, an intransitive subject. Since intransitive subjects do not appear with ergative marking, this straightforwardly accounts for the absence of ergative morphology in the ""split"". The same factors exist in accusative-patterning systems, but the fact that both transitive and intransitive subjects pattern alike (i.e., as nominatives) obscures the ""split"", in this case. The proposed analysis is independent of any specific theory of how case assignment is determined, and casts doubt on the need for a third, ""split"" type of alignment system along side purely accusative and purely ergative, at least as far as the underlying syntax is concerned.",0
"Contrary to recent work in Distributed Morphology adopting Early Root Insertion (the notion that Roots are present from the outset of the syntactic derivation), we argue that Late Insertion applies to Roots just like other morphemes. We support this conclusion with empirical evidence (Root suppletion and hyponymous direct objects in noun incorporation and related constructions) and conceptual considerations (including the beneficial obviation of readjustment operations and the possibility that narrow syntax is universal). Additional data (Latin semi-deponent verbs) allow us to re-cast Embick's (2000) licensing analysis of Latin deponent verbs as a further argument for Late Root Insertion.",0
"In this five-page promissory note, I sketch a model of lexical insertion which combines features of phase-based Distributed Morphology and Nanosyntax. I argue on the basis of Icelandic participle formation that the domain for allomorph competition must include 'outside' material, and on the basis of French fused preposition-determiners that the target for lexical insertion is larger than a single syntactic head. Both of these facts support the contention that lexical insertion occurs in a phase-sized domain, a 'span' of an extended projection. I also suggest that the phonological component plays a direct role in allomorph selection. I achieve modular separation between syntax and phonology by developing a two-stage model of lexical insertion. Within each phase, first there is a syntactic round of lexical matching, followed by phonological interpretation.",0
"Gender features can be divided into two types: natural gender (also called biological gender or sex) and grammatical gender (the arbitrary gender often associated with inanimates).  Morphosyntactic analyses that address both aspects of gender are relatively rare, and they often play down or eliminate the role of natural gender in the morphosyntax.  In this paper, I will argue for a new analysis of the relationship between grammatical gender and natural gender, using evidence from the language Amharic (Ethiosemitic). I show how conventional analyses of gender struggle with Amharic, and develop an alternative analysis that crucially relies on natural gender and grammatical gender both being features on n (cf. Lecarme, 2002, Ferrari, 2005, inter alia; I assume lexical categories are decomposed into a category-defining head and a category-neutral root). Further evidence for the analysis is provided by the unusual interaction of gender and number in Amharic, as well as the morphosyntax of Amharic nominalizations.  The paper concludes with some discussion of the diachrony of gender in Amharic and the cross-linguistic implications of the analysis.",0
"In the so-called kena-passive construction in Singapore English (Bao and Wee 1999), the morphosyntactic realization of the passive feature of irregular verbs is optional (John kena caught/?catch) in contrast to the obligatory realization of the same feature within the English-derived be-passive (John was caught/*catch). We propose that this asymmetry follows from the hybrid syntactic structures of the kena-passive construction. Specifically, we argue that the verb kena allows not only the standard passive structure of the type discussed by Bao and Wee but also the active structure which embeds a sentential complement comprising of pro and the active verb. This analysis is supported by a variety of arguments regarding the kena-active complement structure independently available in Singapore English (Yap and Lim 2011) as well as the Chinese (Feng 1995; Huang 1999) and Baba Malay (Ansaldo and Matthews 1999), which have been hypothesized in the literature as the two major substrate languages of Singapore English.",0
"In this paper we develop an analysis of syncretism in person agreement that captures several typological generalizations motivated in work by Baerman, Brown and Corbett (see Baerman et al. 2005:59 and Baerman and Brown 2011). Our account is based on the following core assumptions. (i) In languages with person agreement, the person specification of the verb is identical to that of the subject, even where this is not reflected by surface forms. (ii) First, second and third person are composed of two features, one shared by first and second person, the other shared by second and third person (see Kerstens 1993, Bennis and MacLean 2007, and Aalberse and Don 2010). (iii) Phi-features are organized in a feature geometry (see Gazdar and Pullum 1982 and Harley and Ritter 2002). (iv) Rules that operate on features (rules of impoverishment and spell-out rules) are sensitive to this geometry. We demonstrate that all four assumptions are motivated independently of the typological generalizations concerning the cross-linguistic frequency of patterns of syncretism. We test our proposal through a case study of Dutch agreement. In different circumstances, this language displays syncretism of second and third person, of first and second person, and even of first and third person, and it therefore provides a challenge for any theory aiming to explain person syncretism.",0

"There seems to be a broad consensus in the literature that in order to describe the fine details of morphological paradigms, one needs something in addition to the syntactic structure and the lexicon. The current paper focuses in detail on case declension of Classical Armenian in order to (re-)evaluate the type of evidence usually brought in favor of separate morphological (or more narrowly paradigm) structure. I argue that once syntax is made sufficiently fine-grained, with individual features corresponding to syntactic heads, paradigm structure may be dispensed with.",0
"Traditionally, Romanian has received a Latin-inspired classification of verbs into 4 (or sometimes 5) conjugational classes based on the ending of their infinitival form. However, this infinitive-based classification proves itself inadequate in describing and accounting for the irregularities of the paradigm, for the alternations and syncretisms that occur. There have been, thus, numerous attempts throughout the history of Romanian linguistics to give other conjugational classifications based on the way the verb actually conjugates. 
In this work, I looked at both the traditional and modern analyses, and attempted to give accounts for the occurring alternations and seeming richness of the paradigm. Since Romanian verbs have different forms to express mood, tense, person, number, gender, and voice, to simplify the analysis, I limited the discussion by focusing on the conjugation of Romanian verbs in the indicative present.",0
"This paper discusses the two passive strategies in the Mainland Scandinavian languages: the periphrastic passive (the so called bli-passive) and the morphological passive (the so called -s-passive). The aim of this paper is to (1) explain the differences between the languages with respect to interpretation and distribution of the two passives, with special focus on the restrictions on -s -passives imposed by tense and conjugation class in Danish, Bokmål and Nynorsk, and (2) to model the choice of passive within the different languages. I will argue that, when available, the morphological passive will always be preferred over the periphrastic passive (which will be argued to follow from an economy principle). Swedish will be argued to be different from the other MLS languages in that it allows copying/agreeing of tense features on to a lower event projection located below a Voice/predicative head, which makes the morphological passive available in all tenses. Due to lack of this mechanism in the other MLS languages, the -s-passive will be unavailable in tensed context for these languages since it gives rise to a mirror violation.",0
"Stress in Maltese provides some of the foundational arguments for the cycle in phonology (Brame 1974). One piece of evidence for the cycle in Maltese occurs in perfective verbs with pronominal (object-marking) suffixes.  Here, syncope of vowels in unstressed, non-final open syllables underapplies in manner which suggests that, prior to object suffixation, there is a cycle of stress on the stem (plus the subject suffix, if any). Odden (1990, 1993) points out a paradoxical exception to this pattern: vowel-final (third weak radical) verbs with object suffixes fail to show this evidence of an inner-cycle stress. In this paper I propose an analysis of the asymmetry between C-final and V-final stems cast within Optimal Interleaving (OI: Wolf 2008), a theory of phonology-morphology interaction situated within McCarthy's (2007) OT with Candidate Chains. The analysis relies crucially on the fact that extrinsic ordering in OT-CC is enforced via pairwise ordering requirements (the PREC constraints) which are violable and potentially conflicting: normally Maltese requires that stress be assigned prior to object suffixation, but this is over-ridden with V-final stems by a requirement that stress assignment take place after (pre-suffixal) vowel lengthening. It has previously been noted (Wilson 2006; Wolf 2009, 2010) that OT-CC is able to produce such transitivity paradoxes in ordering, echoing in certain ways Anderson's (1969, 1974) theory of Local Ordering, which also treats ordering as a pairwise relation. The Maltese facts suggest that this ability is desirable in a theory of phonology-morphology ordering relations.",0
"The paper focuses on an interesting form of (person) indexical shift in
the Dravidian language Tamil which surfaces as 1 SG agreement marking in a clause embedded under a speech predicate. I show that this agreement is an instance of indexical shift and label it ""monstrous agreement"". However, I demonstrate that its full range of empirical properties cannot be adequately explained by the major analyses of indexical shift in the literature. The bulk of these, I argue, in addition to being predominantly semantic in spirit, and thus ill-equipped to deal with a morphosyntactic phenomenon like agreement, also involve two core misconceptions regarding indexicality vs. logophoricity on the one hand and speech vs. attitude predicates on the other. I propose that these core assumptions be strongly re-evaluated from first principles and that syntactic and typological clues on the subject be paid more heed. I propose a new analysis of the Tamil paradigms which derives indexical shift within an enriched grammatical model involving contextual features
instantiated in a structurally articulated functional sequence of the clausal left periphery.",0
"A main motivation for relegating Word Formation to the lexicon is the fact that its output is often non-compositional.  The present article, however, presentsa serious challenge to the presumed contradiction between non-compositionality and syntactic combinatorial processes.  The investigation of N-N Constructs in Hebrew shows that equal syntactically complex expressions nonetheless interact differently with non-compositionality.  Crucially, it is the syntactic differences between these expressions that give rise to distinct Content properties, with non-compositionality correlating not with syntactic structure as such, but with the presence of functional structure.

The emerging syntactic domain of 'word' Content in turn allows the language learner to make informed decisions on where to look for non-compositionality and to draw the appropriate structural conclusions from its presence.",0
"Languages commonly exhibit alternations governed by complex combinations of phonological, morphological, and lexical factors. An alternation of this sort will often admit a wide variety of analyses, each apportioning different roles to lexical storage and to morphological and phonological computation. Such analytic underdetermination poses a threat to falsifiability and to learnability: hypotheses can easily evade empirical disconfirmation if potential counterexamples can be redescribed in many different ways to suit the linguists convenience, and so theories risk losing empirical content; by the same token, it becomes hard to explain how, among a plethora of choices, learners converge upon the target grammar (§2). To avert these dangers, the theory of grammar must set limits to the space of possible interactions between phonology, morphology, and the lexicon: in particular, it must ascertain the proper division of labour between storage and computation (§3), and it must constrain the ways in which morphological operations can manipulate phonological material and in which phonological processes can refer to morphosyntactic information (§4).





        Concerning the question of storage vs computation, this paper pursues the hypothesis that different types of alternation reflect different modes of interaction between the lexicon and the grammar. This idea is fleshed out by means of a refined dual-route approach to exponence (§3.1, §3.5), in which the well-established distinction between explicit symbolic generalization and implicit pattern association (§3.1, §3.4) is supplemented with a novel distinction between two types of lexical listing, analytic and nonanalytic, akin to Clahsen and Neubauers (2010: 2634) contrast between combinatorial entries and unanalysed entries (§3.1, §3.3.1). Assuming a stratal version of Optimality Theory (OT), I show that the peculiar syndrome of properties characteristic of stem-level morphophonology arises from the fact that stem-level forms are stored nonanalytically but stem-level processes are nonetheless explicitly represented in the grammar by means of symbolic generalizations, whose status resembles that of Jackendoffs (1975) lexical redundancy rules (§3.3.1). The model provides a highly explanatory account of internal cyclic effects in stem-level domains, which I illustrate with classic examples such as English _órigin ~ oríginal ~ orìginálity_ (§3.3.2) and _còmp[ə]nsátion_ vs _cònd[ɛ]nsátion_ (§3.3.3).





        On the issue of the interaction between morphology and phonology, this paper argues for the adoption of a restrictive stance based on general cognitive principles of modularity and locality (§4.1). A programme is proposed consisting of four hypotheses (37): that morphology selects and concatenates morphs without ever altering their phonological content (§4.2); that phonological constraints other than those on prosodic alignment may not refer to morphosyntactic information (§4.3); that output phonological representations do not contain diacritics of morphosyntactic affiliation (§4.4); and that morphosyntactic conditioning in phonology is subject to cyclic locality (§4.4). These hypotheses will provide the guiding thread for an evaluation of several mechanisms currently used to describe morphologically conditioned phonological processes, including construction-specific cophonologies (§4.2.3), indexed constraints (§4.3), and readjustment rules (§4.3). The balance of argument supports a stratal-cyclic architecture for phonologyone, however, in which neither cyclicity nor stratification are innately stipulated, but both emerge from fundamental storage and processing mechanisms (§3.3.2, §3.3.3) and from timing effects in the childs linguistic development (§4.2.3).",0
"In present-day English, the phonological process of /l/-darkening displays a remarkable amount of variation depending on the position of its target in the word or phrase.  Syllable-based accounts state that light [l] occurs in onsets (e.g. _light_) and dark [l] in codas (e.g. _dull_). However, several studies, notably Hayes (2000), report overapplication of darkening to onset /l/ in certain morphosyntactically defined positions: e.g. word-finally in phrases such as _heal it_, and stem-finally before a suffix in words such as _heal-ing_.  These onset-position dark [l]s show that /l/-darkening is not just variable, but also sensitive to morphosyntactic structure.  This fact poses a particularly tough challenge for phonological theory: an adequate account of English /l/-darkening presupposes both a theory of the grammatical representation of phonological variation and a theory of the morphosyntax-phonology interface. 

Boersma & Hayes (2001) approach this problem by modelling Hayes's data in Stochastic Optimality Theory, using Output-Output Correspondence as their theory of the morphosyntax-phonology interface.  However, their approach is problematic as it predicts impossible grammars that can only be avoided by means of innate ranking stipulations.  Accordingly, this paper presents a reanalysis of Hayes's data using a novel combination of Stochastic and Stratal OT. I argue that this analysis is an improvement on Boersma & Hayes's parallel stochastic model because it does not rely on fixed innate constraint rankings and it does not generate impossible grammars. Moreover, I show that observations about the life cycle of phonological processes enable us to deduce quantitative predictions about the rate of /l/-darkening in different environments: in particular, the process should apply with lower frequency in smaller morphosyntactic domains, where it has been active for shorter periods of time. This prediction is corroborated by new data obtained by means of a novel method for determining cycle-specific rates of application of variable phonological processes.",1
"This dissertation is about the elements that build verbs, the elements that introduce arguments, and how these elements interact to determine the interpretation of arguments and events. A theory of argument structure is a theory how arguments are introduced syntactically, interpreted semantically, and marked morphologically, and how this information is linked to predicates and their morphological shape.  Through a detailed empirical study of Icelandic verbal alternations, this dissertation contributes to a line of research in which much of the work of argument structure is handled by the syntax, the component of language responsible for combining elements into larger structures, rather than a pre-syntactic lexicon. 


The major theoretical contribution of this thesis is a syntactic theory of argument structure which is much more syntactically autonomous than its closest relatives. The system proposed shares with construction-based approaches to argument structure the assumption that structures generate meanings independent of the lexical roots embedded in them. That is, lexical roots play a secondary role in effecting argument structures. However, it differs from most  syntactic approaches in that the syntax is far less deterministic of semantics, much as late insertion theories of morphology take syntax to underdetermine morphophonology.  


In the present theory, syntactic structure may underdetermine interpretation in three ways. First, a functional head may be compatible with multiple `allosemes', or denotations, which are decided post-syntactically on the basis of surrounding material. The categorial v head, for example, may have the interpretation of an activity or a cause (among other possible interpretations), depending on the interpretation of its complement. Second, a DP may be interpreted as an entity, or may be type-shifted to be interpreted as a (stative) eventuality. Third, a lexical root is associated with a web of possible semantic contributions, but the selection from among them is made on the basis of surrounding structure, after such structure has been built.",0
"This paper proposes a new analysis of the crossed-control construction in Standard Indonesian observed by Kaswanti Purwo (1984) and Gil (2002) and recently analyzed by Polinsky and Potsdam (2002). Indonesian verbs of wanting such as mau/ingin „want‟ behave as ordinary subject-control verbs but when they embed a passive complement, they exhibit a ""crossed-reading""; the matrix subject is thematically related to the embedded verb whereas the embedded oblique phrase is construed as the agent of the matrix verb in apparent violation of the standard locality constraint on θ-role assignment. Adopting the theory of feature inheritance (Chomsky 2007, 2008) and the recent analysis of θ-roles as formal features (see Bošković and Takahashi 1998, Hornstein 1999, inter alia), we propose that θ-features can be inherited from a verbal phase onto another as long as there is no other phase boundary in between. Our analysis correctly predicts that the crossed-control reading becomes unavailable once overt phase heads such as the C untuk „for‟ and the v prefix meN- intervene between the higher verb of wanting and the subordinate verb.",0

"Icelandic passive and perfect participles are formed using one of two primary suffixes, -D (edh) for weak verbs and -in for strong verbs. These suffixes are followed by adjectival inflections. A special class of weak verbs exhibits a 'mixed' declension, in which the weak suffix is used before adjectival inflections that begin with a vowel, and the strong suffix is used in other contexts. This shows that participle formation in the mixed declension is sensitive to the phonology of an 'outside' affix, looking away from the stem. This has repercussions for the theory of morphology. In particular it supports a framework in which the cycle for lexical insertion is bigger than a morpheme.",0
"fact is problematic for standard views of the prosody-morhology interface in Greek, for which it is usually assumed that inflectional categories cannot uniquely determine the stress pattern of a word. Furthermore, antepenultimate stress is not otherwise known as an effect of affixal morphology.

It is shown how this analysis fits in with our current morphosyntactic and phonological knowledge of the structure of the Greek verb.",0
"This dissertation provides a novel perspective on the interaction between quantifier scope and ellipsis. It presents a detailed investigation of the scopal interaction between English negative indefinites, modals, and quantified phrases in ellipsis. One of the crucial observations is that a negative indefinite in object position cannot scope out of a verbal ellipsis site, while Quantifier Raising (QR) of a quantificational object can escape a verbal ellipsis site. 

This dissertation presents a unified account of this state of affairs in the context of multidominance. It is argued that both English negative indefinites and quantificational determiners decompose into two independent elements. Their formation is the result of a morphological process, Fusion Under Adjacency. The locality/adjacency required for fusion is established under remerge (multidominance), in combination with cyclic Spell-Out/linearization. The main claim of this dissertation is that the PF-process of ellipsis can block this morphological process. It is proposed that the timing of Fusion Under Adjacency and (derivational) ellipsis plays a crucial role: Fusion Under Adjacency has to take place before the ellipsis licensor is merged. The lack of a blocking effect of ellipsis in QR is accounted for by the fact that QR always has a landing site below the ellipsis licensor.

In addition to providing an account for the scopal behavior of quantificational elements under ellipsis, this dissertation also sheds new light on the syntax-to-PF mapping. It contributes to our understanding of how multidominant phrase markers are transferred to PF for (non-)pronunciation in a cyclic model of the grammar.

This study is of relevance to scholars interested in the nature of ellipsis and quantifier scope, and the syntax-PF connection, as well as to a general syntactic readership.",0
"Case variation can, to a large extent, be analyzed in terms of only two atomic 'ingredients': event licensing of NPs by heads and PF marking of the licensing relation (where marking is analyzed in terms of 'Chomskyan' case stars).

"Many recent and not so recent debates on noun incorporation (NI) pit a syntactic analysis (Baker, 1988, 1996; Haugen, 2008; Sadock, 1980, 1986) against a lexical origin (Di Sciullo and Williams, 1987; Rosen, 1989) of NI constructions. Within the past 10 years or so, many researchers have abandoned any sort of generative lexicon in favour of the so-called single-engine hypothesis in which word formation is handled strictly in the syntax, with the possibility of some post-syntactic re-arrangements (Halle & Marantz, 1993; Julien, 2002; Marantz, 1997, 2001; inter alia). The goal of this paper is to examine how these discussions on NI bear on the Lexicalist Hypothesis. I will end the discussion with some brief remarks on bare noun constructions in some East Asian languages and compare these to the NI constructions discussed here.",0
"Spans are complement sequences of heads, e.g. if T selects VP as a complement, and V is the head of VP, then T-V is a span. That spans are a significant entity for syntax has been implicitly recognized in the Head Movement Constraint: A head may only move to the head selecting it, thus a head may only move within a span (e.g. V can move to T). Brody's Mirror theory goes so far as to equate spans with words (so if T and V do not form a word, then in that case VP is not the complement of T), replacing head movement with a linearization instruction for a complex head (e.g. a V-T word can spell out in V (English) or T (French)). This suggests a close connection between spell-out and spans, one which I develop in this paper. I claim the following: Spans are targets for morpheme insertion (so T-V could in principle be spelled out by a single morpheme, without any movement being necessary, and regardless of whether V also has a complement---contra Brody, a span is not necessarily a word). I develop this position through a close examination of a few portmanteau preposition-determiner forms in French (de+le=du, and à+le=au). The interaction of syntax and phonology in the selection of the correct allomorph sheds much light on the nature of spell-out and lexical insertion.",0
"In this thesis, I argue that the obligatory nature of agreement in phi-features (henceforth, phi-agreement) cannot be captured by appealing to ""derivational time-bombs"" -- elements of the initial representation that cannot be part of a well-formed, end-of-the-derivation structure, and which are eliminated by the application of phi-agreement itself (as in Chomsky's 2000, 2001 _uninterpretable features_ approach, for example). Instead, it requires recourse to an _operation_ -- one whose invocation is obligatory, but whose successful culmination is not enforced by the grammar.

I then discuss the implications of this conclusion for the analysis of defective intervention by dative nominals. These results lead to a novel view of the interaction of phi-agreement with case, furnishing an argument that both phi-agreement and so-called ""morphological case"" must be computed within the syntactic component of the grammar.

Finally, I survey other domains where the same _operations_-based logic proves well-suited to model the empirical state of affairs; these include Object Shift, the Definiteness Effect, and long-distance wh-movement.

The thesis examines data from the Kichean languages of the Mayan family (primarily from Kaqchikel), as well as from Basque, Icelandic, and French.",1
"Sometimes it is the oddest facts that provide the best clues to significant properties of language, because their very oddity limits the space in which we are likely to search for possible explanations. In this paper, I argue that the strange behavior of Russian nominal phrases containing what are traditionally called the ""paucal numerals"" ('two', 'three' and 'four') provide clues of just this type concerning the syntactic side of morphological case.



When a nominal phrase like the Russian counterpart of 'these last two beautiful tables' occupies a nominative environment, the pre-numeral demonstrative and adjective ('these last') bear nominative plural morphology, and the numeral itself is nominative. The post- numeral adjective ('beautfiul'), however, is often genitive plural; and the noun ('table') is genitive singular -- a situation that the illustrious Russian grammarian Peshkovsky (1956) characterized as ""a typical example of the degree to which grammatical and logical thinking may diverge"".



I suggest that the behavior of these phrases is actually entirely logical -- once one adopts a particular structural analysis of the Russian DP. and a particular view of the nature of case morphology itself:  that the case affixes themselves -- traditionally classified using case-specific sui generis terminology (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, etc.)-- are actually instantiations of the various syntactic categories: D, N, P and V.  This proposal raises the possibility that there is no special theory of morphological case.",0
"The paper investigates Clitic Left Dislocation (CLLD) in Modern Greek as a morphological phenomenon. The ""clitic"" in CLLD is a spellout of DO-agreement features. The paper also shows the superiority of a movement approach to CLLD (rather than a base-generation analysis). Comments welcome!",0
"Within generative grammar, noun incorporation and other compounding processes have traditionally been the focus of morpho-syntacticians, while reduplication has been investigated primarily by morpho-phonologists. The interaction of these two phenomena in a single language has significant implications that go beyond the narrow concerns of these two sub-domains, bearing much more broadly on the architecture of grammatical theory. This paper investigates the interactions of reduplication and compounding within one language, Hiaki (Yaqui). Reduplication for aspectual inflection in Hiaki occurs inside of compounds and other derived words, marking the head of the word. We demonstrate the major architectural issues resting on the analysis of these phenomena by examining how different theoretical perspectives can (or cannot) accommodate the Hiaki data. Architectures which separate inflection and derivation into separate grammatical components (Weak Lexicalist theories) cannot account for the data, while theories maintaining the two processes in the same component fare better but tend to require some supplemental architectural accommodations. Strong Lexicalist theories and Paradigm Function Morphology can account for head-marking reduplication in Hiaki, but other data from the language problematize major premises of these theories. The syntacticocentric approach we advocate also requires supplementation (Local Dislocation) to correctly position inflectional reduplicants inside compound verb forms, but this is a well-established and independently motivated mechanism within the Distributed Morphology framework.",0
"Rhotacism in Latin is a well-known phonological generalisation which, in its paradigm cases, can be stated as a regular sound change of [s] to [r] between vowels.  This change/rule is posited on the basis both of comparative evidence, e.g. *swesor > Latin soror 'sister', and of paradigms in which final s alternates with medial intervocalic r, e.g. flos, floris 'flower'.  It is possible, however, to cite a number of exceptions to the basic rule, which, if one attempts to account for all of them in a synchronic grammar, amount to outright paradoxes. This paper presents a diachronic model of the progress of rhotacism through the expected life-cycle of a phonological process, within the formalism of Stratal Optimality Theory, and demonstrates that this model can account for the exceptions to rhotacism as epiphenomena of the expected progress of the constraint ranking giving rise to it from phrase- to word-level, and from word- to stem-level. Finally, I argue that rhotacism became a systematic property of the lexicon, at which point it was subject to analogical extension, giving the paradigm levelling observed in e.g. honor, honoris 'honour' (formerly honos, honoris).",0
"Hebrew and Arabic attributive adjectives agree in definiteness with the nouns they modify in addition to their agreement in gender and number. Previous studies consist of two competing accounts for the definiteness agreement. Under the first account, the definite marker _ha_ is a D head selecting the adjective it marks for definiteness (similarly to nouns) (e.g. Sichel 2002); under the second account, the definite marker is a syntactic definiteness feature inherent to the noun or determiner, which spreads to other elements in the DP (e.g. Borer 1996).

In this paper, I present novel data from degree modification of coordinated adjectives in Hebrew and Arabic. I show that the scope ambiguities and definiteness marking patterns in various structures provide evidence for an analysis whereby definiteness is a syntactic feature that surfaces as the phrasal clitic _ha-_ 'the'. In addition, I show that the structure-sensitive, though post-syntactic, morphological operation of LOCAL DISLOCATION generates the correct distribution of the Hebrew and Arabic definite marker, namely it being a phrasal proclitic occurring at the left-edge of phrases, as well as the intricate pattern of definiteness agreement in Hebrew and Arabic attributive adjectives.",0
"Evidence from the Uto-Aztecan language Hiaki (Yaqui) shows that the internal structure of the verb phrase is tripartite, made up of (at least) VoiceP, vP and a lexical projection (√P or VP). The interaction of applicative and causative morphology, the existence of two kinds of causatives, and the interaction of passive and verbalizing morphology show that the external-argument introducing projection VoiceP (Kratzer 1996) must be distinct from the verbalizing head vP (Marantz 1997), as first proposed by Pylkkänen (2002) and subsequently by Cuervo (2003), Collins (2005), Alexiadou, Anagnostopoulou, and Schäfer (2006), Merchant (2008) and Harley (2009), among many others. This result stands in opposition to earlier proposals in which a single projection, vP, serves both to verbalize and to introduce the external argument, following Chomsky (1995), Marantz (1997), Harley (1995). It also challenges the conclusions of Coon and Preminger (2011), who give explicit arguments for the identity of external-argument-introducing Voice and verbalizing v.",0
"This article investigates the hypothesis that infinitives clauses in Breton are Case-filtered. This hypothesis makes a straightforward prediction for the distribution of infinitive clauses: Bare infinitives appear in positions where direct Case is available to them. Prepositional infinitives appear as a last resort, in positions where no Case is available. In these environments, 'da', homophonous with a preposition, appears at the left-edge of the infinitive clause. I propose that 'da' realizes Inherent Case. I show that once the paradigms of semantically motivated preposition insertion are set apart, the hypothesis shows correct for control and ECM structures, with both intervening subjects and objects, purpose clauses and their alternation paradigms, including some preposition tripling paradigms. Larger infinitive structures in narrative matrix infinitives and concessive clauses are not Case-filtered. This makes Breton similar to English, where only perception and causative structures are Case-filtered, whereas other infinitive structures are not (Hornstein, Martins and Nunes 2008).",0
"It has been suggested that the Romance first person singular indicative forms a base of derivation for the subjunctive paradigm, even though the latter shares no morphosyntactic features with the former (Maiden, 2004). The existence of such patterns has been taken to be an argument for autonomous morphology and the existence of unnatural 'morphomes', in the sense of Aronoff (1994). Experimental investigations with native speakers of Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish reveal that this pattern is underlearned, and that speakers do not generalize it to novel forms, instead preferring the 2nd person singular as a base of derivation. The results implicate a role for naturalness biases in morphological structure, and an awareness that the first person singular is an unreliable and idiosyncratic base for productive inflectional identity.",0
"Uspanteko (Guatemala; ~2000 speakers) is an endangered K'ichean-branch Mayan language. It is unique among the K'ichean languages in that, along with obligatory right-edge stress, Uspanteko has innovated a system of contrastive pitch accent.
 Word-level accent in Uspanteko is of theoretical interest for several reasons. First, it has a mixed accentual system with both stress and lexical pitch accent. Second, lexical pitch has striking effects on prosodic and segmental structure, interacting with stress shift, vowel length, vowel quality, and two deletion processes. Third, pitch accent is closely tied to morphology (especially possessive marking) even though the location of morphologically-derived tone is entirely a matter of surface phonology. Fourth, interactions between tone and vowel length provide evidence for lexical strata within
the accentual system of Uspanteko.
 In this paper we develop a novel analysis of Uspanteko accent, using data drawn
from previous research as well as our own recent fieldwork. We propose that the
location of pitch accent and stress in Uspanteko can be straightforwardly captured under three assumptions: (i) Uspanteko words contain a single right-aligned iamb; (ii) pitch accent must dock to the head of a foot; and (iii) pitch accent cannot dock to a word-final mora. These assumptions account for default word-final stress, as well as penultimate stress in [CVCV] words bearing pitch accent, which we treat as an iambic-trochaic foot form reversal. Interactions between prosody and segmental structure in Uspanteko are analyzed as the result of further constraints on foot shape, stress assignment, and tone non-finality. A surprising finding of this paper is that there is robust evidence for foot structure in Uspanteko, despite the fact that accent in
Uspanteko could easily be described in non-metrical terms. Finally, we model
accentual cophonologies in Uspanteko using partially-ordered prosodic constraints.",0
"This paper presents some peculiar Slovenian data that exhibit doubling of certain functional morphemes in a single word, specifically, of a spatio-temporal deictic marker/demonstrative reinforcer and of case markers. The paper offers an overview of the basic paradigms and a first attempt at an analysis. We suggest that when analyzed correctly, our data actually turn out not to be that unexpected. We also show that in exhibiting such data, Slovenian is actually not that peculiar, since similar phenomena have been found in several languages.",0
"This paper explores the idea that certain locality effects on phonologically conditioned allomorphy and external sandhi processes can be explained by the locality of production planning. The first part of this paper presents evidence for this hypothesis based on locality effects in phonological conditions on the choice of allomorph of the affix /ing/ between [in] and [iN]. A second and more speculative part explores how this view sheds new light on a number of puzzles that earlier accounts of locality in phonology failed to address: Why is it that sandhi processes tend to be variable, and what can this variability tell us about the nature of phrasal phonology? Why is it the case that different kinds of sandhi processes come with different kinds of locality conditions that seem to depend on their phonological substance? Why is it that lexical frequency and collocational cooccurrence seem to be able to affect sandhi processes in addition to syntactic and phonological factors?",0
"Adnominal postpositional phrases in Basque need to be licensed by the attributive linker -ko on the right edge of the PP, which is absent if the PP is not contained inside a DP. Rejecting an analysis in terms of Predicate Inversion, I suggest that the linker represents a functional category at the high end of the extended projection of P, which establishes the proper relation between modifier and modifiee in situ. Semantically, it adjusts the semantic type of its complement, so as to license semantic composition by means of Functional
Application. Dispensing with the non-saturating operation of Predicate Modification allows a principled explanation of the linker's obligatory presence with adnominal PPs.",0
"The main idea suggested in this paper is that subordinate clauses need to be Case licensed (namely embedded under KPs) and that various patterns of ""fusion"" within a layered functional skeleton obliterate that process. I will provide two types of empirical support for this proposal. First, I will show that this proposal correctly allows for nominal elements to stand in for a whole embedded clause (using the mechanism of Phrasal Spell-Out, Starke 2009; Neeleman & Szendroi 2007). Second, I will show that a wide range of typologically unrelated languages overtly exhibit Case marking on complementizers. Also, direct evidence against the identity of relative pronouns and complementizers / subordinators, possibly suggested -prima facie- by the layered model proposed here, will be provided here with the aid of data from Akkadian, Germanic languages and West Iranian languages.",0
"In velarising dialects of Spanish, nasal place contrasts neutralise to [ŋ] word-finally. However, whereas velarisation applies transparently in word-final prepausal environments, place neutralisation ""overapplies"" to stem-final presuffixal nasals and to word-final nasals which resyllabify into onset position across word-boundaries. Yet since previous analyses of Velarising Spanish have been based exclusively on theory-led interpretations of impressionistic data, doubts exist as to whether word-final nasals in velarising dialects are consistently realised as [ŋ] (Baković 2000). The first goal of this paper therefore is to submit the claims put forward in these analyses to empirical testing. Experiments using electropalatography confirm that speakers of Velarising Spanish produce robustly dorso-velar nasals in word-final environments; this result refutes the claim that word-final nasals are placeless in velarising varieties. Secondly, because opaque instances of nasal place neutralisation pose challenges for Optimality Theory, I compare two approaches to modelling the nasal alternations in Velarising Spanish, namely Output-Output correspondence in classic OT and a cyclic analysis in Stratal OT. This comparison reveals that classic OT cannot account for the opaque patterns without stipulating fixed OO-constraint rankings. By contrast, the stratal model straightforwardly predicts the occurrence of both opacity effects on the basis of general architectural principles.",0
"This paper focuses on the evolution of Romance clitic sequences with the intent of providing a principled account of various 'regular irregularities'. I will argue that they result from a parametric change reversing the order of certain combinations of clitic elements from the archaic pattern (acc > dat) to the innovative one (dat > acc), in which clitics mirror the order of their nominal counterparts.
  Building on Kayne 1994:19-21, I argue that the change leading to the mirror order is due to the movement and the consequent left-adjunction of the dative clitic to the accusative one. According to Kayne's terminology, the resulting configuration is a true cluster, while the other clitic combinations were split. On the basis of data from Italo-Romance vernaculars, I show that the clusters with the mirror order differ from the others under a series of syntactic and morpho-phonological aspects, which ultimately support the cluster vs split distinction.",0
"Recent approaches to the syntax of manner-expressing verbs establish a consensus about the primitive syntactic nature of the manner component. For instance, Haugen (2009) and Mateu (2011) assume a special syntactic operation through which manner is syntactically generated, called conflation, in which manner is introduced by a root which externally merges with the verbal head by head adjunction. One (partial) exception to this tendency is found in Zubizarreta and Oh (2007), who treat the manner component in languages like Korean as a structural complex headed by a lexical verb, which enters a serial verb construction with another verb. This paper offers a series of arguments in favor of the view that the manner component universally presents a bare unergative VP. A consequence is that syntactic explanations for the behavior of manner-expressing verbs have to be formulated in a different way, which does not crucially rely on the atomic status of manner. The paper argues that the model that Zubizarreta & Oh (2007) designed for Korean, involving a verb with a complement adjoined to the lexical verb, is also the correct analysis for the observed phenomena in the Indo-European type of languages, and perhaps even a universal model of manner-expressing verbs.",0
"Even though vowel deletion in Russian is lexically restricted, the identity of alternating vowels is partially predictable: only mid vowels delete, but even mid vowels cannot delete in some contexts. We report on two nonce word studies asking Russian speakers to rate paradigms in which a vowel was deleted. The ratings strongly correlated with the quality of the vowel: deletion of mid vowels was rated higher than deletion of high and low vowels. We also found that deletion in certain syllabic contexts was rated as ungrammatical: deletion cannot affect words that have a complex coda, and it cannot create clusters with a medial sonorant. Finally, deletion in disyllables was rated higher than deletion in monosyllables, reflecting the trends in the lexicon. These results suggest that even for this lexically restricted alternation, speakers have formed a phonological generalization.",0
"This article surveys empirical and theoretical work on Tense-Aspect-Mood (""TAM"") based split ergativity, and offers an account for how it arises. While these splits are typically assumed to represent a unified phenomenon, I demonstrate that non-ergative portions of split systems exhibit different patterns, and argue that these reflect at least two different processes which trigger the splits: (i) non-perfective aspects are more likely to be built on complex auxiliary constructions, and (ii) imperfectivity is associated with demoted objects or lower transitivity. Both motivations trigger the same result: in the ""split"" portions of the grammar the transitive subject is not marked with ergative case because it is not a transitive subject. This structural account of split ergativity allows us to avoid positing different variable feature inventories on the same functional head (cf. Ura 2006), and also provides a straight-forward account of the so-called ""counter-universal"" splits (Gildea and de Castro Alves 2010), which cause problems for purely functionalist accounts (e.g. DeLancey 1981). Furthermore, it is shown that the factors which trigger these splits are not limited to ergative languages, but are present cross-linguistically-they are not visible in nominative-accusative systems because (by definition) there is no visible difference between transitive and intransitive subjects. The prevalence of splits in ergative systems is thus not taken to reflect any deep instability of ergativity.",0
"The proposal to be presented provides a syntactic analysis of Polish cardinal numerals 5< with reference to their history and development. In particular, it provides an account of the so-called Accusative Hypothesis according to which numeral expressions with 5< are intrinsically accusative  (Małecki 1863, Krasnowolski 1897, Szober 1928, Przepiórkowski 1996, 2004, Franks 2002). Despite it being a contentious issue , the Accusative Hypothesis has been used by some as an explanation to the puzzling syntax of these numeral expressions (Franks 2002, Przepiórkowski 1996, 2004, Rutkowski 2007). These proposals notwithstanding, none of them goes beyond the mere statement of the hypothesis or answers the question pertinent to the source of ACC and thus the main goal of this paper is to provide such an answer. The analysis is based on Pesetsky & Torrego's (2004) proposal according to which all structural case is a result of tense checking. It will be argued that there is a special tense head introducing numeral expressions with 5<, a (null) light p, whose selectional properties are sensitive to the presence of a lexicalised Num0 – the head which, it will be argued, these numerals lexicalise.",0
"In this paper, we argue that an expanded conception of the distinction between
speaker-oriented and subject-oriented inferences is crucial for understanding
the motivations and mechanisms of semantic change in grammaticalization
and subjectification, on the one hand, and for clarifying the links between
semantic change and reductive formal changes, on the other. Speaker-oriented
inferences have significant consequences, leading to the relaxation of
selectional restrictions on a construction. In turn, the relaxation of selectional
restrictions can create conditions in which the type and token frequency of a
construction can rise considerably. Furthermore, changes in the selectional
restrictions on a construction can themselves catalyze semantic change by
coercing listeners into new form–function pairings. This framework is applied
to allative futures, a typological comparative concept developed in order to
compare structurally diverse future tenses. Following the typological
discussion, a diachronic case study of the emergence and grammaticalization
of a verbless allative future in Ancient Egyptian is presented. Such verbless
allative futures provide evidence against assumptions that purpose constructions
as such are not grammaticalized as future tense constructions (Schmidtke-
Bode 2009). Rather, they corroborate earlier hypotheses that it is the allative
component of source constructions that crucially leads to intention meanings,
and from intention to prediction (see, e.g., Bybee, Pagliuca, and Perkins 1994).",0
"Adjectives in many Indo-European languages morphologically agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number and case (if the language's nouns can differ in case). These agreeing items seem to undermine several otherwise broad generalizations about morphology, word order and phrasal stress. Mysteriously, agreement in Germanic languages is limited to pre-nominal attributes, while all adjectives agree in Romance and Slavic languages. 
This essay proposes to analyze adjectival agreement in terms of a ""Derived Nominal Hypothesis,"" which assigns agreeing adjectives a word-internal nominal structure whose head is the agreement suffix itself. Consequently, these ""adjectives"" are actually Nouns (by Lieber's Right Hand Head Rule), and so qualify as unexceptional heads of NPs. This supports Abney's controversial conjecture for pre-nominal attributive adjectives (that they are heads of NPs). The Derived Nominal Hypothesis additionally succeeds in making several traditional observations on the behavior of agreeing adjectives fully compatible with current explanatory grammatical theory. It also accounts for many previously puzzling morphological properties of agreement and its syntactic distribution in those languages on which the study primarily focuses, namely Dutch, German, Latin and Czech. To a lesser extent, the essays toches on English adjectival word order and on common properties of Spanish and Latin agreement.",0
"In this paper, I deal with the morphophonology of Bosnian nominal declensions. I propose a new insight into the behavior of the vocalic alternations occurring throughout the system. In particular, I show that the final vowel of each Bosnian noun results from the combination of three distinct phonological items, and that these items are the exponents of one and only one morphosyntactic property. These exponents are the basic elements of a Bosnian noun and are combined in one complex marker in the phonology.",0
"Despite the high productivity in English of denominal verb formation by conversion, a constraint on possible interpretations is identified: intransitive denominal conversion verbs are infelicitous where the
source nominal is intended to be an incremental theme (#apple 'eat apple'), a patient (#shirt 'wear shirt'), or the holder of a result state (#window 'open window').  This little-studied constraint is compared to a well-known constraint on denominal conversion verbs in which the source nominal is intended as an agent or cause (#it cowed a calf 'the cow had a calf', Hale and Keyser, 1993), accounted for in previous literature by a prohibition on incorporation in sublexical syntax from specifier position. To account for both constraints it is proposed that nominal roots in English denominal conversion verbs do not originate in argument position, but adjoin directly to subeventual heads, and are interpreted as predicates of events. A prediction is made that English denominal conversion verbs should exhibit the same argument and event structure possibilities as verbs built from verbal roots, which is confirmed by a corpus study of 250 verbs from each class. Nominal roots, however, have a significantly higher likelihood of being lexicalized as transitive verbs than verbal roots do. A study is further undertaken of the semantics of English denominal conversion verbs, resulting in a reformulation of Kiparsky's (1997) Canonical Use Constraint; specifically, it is proposed that a canonical event type associated with a nominal root can be a default interpretation for a denominal conversion verb if and only if the argument structure template of the canonical event type can be unified with the arguments of the denominal verb. The role of pragmatics in the interpretion of English denominal conversion verbs is considered, and it is suggested that apparent exceptions to the constraint on themes, patients, and result states can be attributed to re-interpretation of the verb as an agent-oriented manner verb.",0

"In this paper we focus on the behaviour of prenominal genitives in Old Romanian in contrast with Modern Romanian. In the old language, the prenominal genitive is more widely used and occurs in three distinct configurations: (i) it is a determiner genitive in DP-initial position and checks the definiteness feature of D in a local configuration, (ii) it is a lower determiner genitive which checks the definiteness feature of D across an intervening constituent, and (iii) it is an attributive/property genitive, similar to the attributive genitive of English and to the genitival adjectives of (certain) Slavic languages. Of these three distinct configurations, only the first one is still available in Modern Romanian. In trying to provide an explanation for the loss of some of the prenominal genitive patterns, we relate this phenomenon to changes in syntax of the definite article.",0
"The implementation of argument structural effects on word-formation is a vital aspect in modeling the lexical system and the interface between morphology and syntax.

"This paper claims that the hierarchical structure of morphosyntax is mapped onto a
linear sequence of elements with prominence and different strengths of juncture, which play a role in parsing the structure intended by the speaker. The mapping of left-branching and right-branching structure shows asymmetry in the strengths of juncture. This junctural asymmetry comes from the phonetic implementation of speech signals. It is argued that the strong juncture in left-branching structure makes it quasi-compound. Unmarked word-stress location works as a constraint on complement movement, deriving left-branching from right-branching structure in the base, thus taking the place of a head-directionality parameter. This analysis therefore dispenses with the need for linear information in morphosyntax.",0
"In this paper I present a novel view of the German dative and genitive morphs 'm, r' and 's' as contextual allomorphs of a single morpheme, call it OK (oblique kase). OK, I claim, is categorially distinct from nominative and accusative determiner / adjective agreement. I discuss six syntactic contrasts supporting this claim. The consequences are important: (i) the superficial syncretism pattern in German oblique case marking is epiphenomenal and hence resolved without reference to morphological means such as underspecification, and  (ii) the distribution of dative and genitive morphology does not inform an analysis of the German weak / strong adjectival declension alternation, the two being separate phenomena.",1
"I argue that German 'ein' is not always an ""indefinite article"", and, pursuing the idea that there is only one 'ein', it is, hence, never an ""indefinite article"". 

Then I explore some consequences for the structural representation of certain function words which contain 'ein' as one of their components, in particular 'kein', as well as its English counterpart 'no'.

In addressing the status/category of 'ein', I propose that an analysis of 'ein' should take into account certain parallels with prepositions such as 'in, of, de', and reduced variants thereof. Spinning the thread a little further I arrive at the view that negative function words are syntactically complex and that negation may always originate within a nominal projection.",0
In this paper I deal with clitic doubling and address the general question of a syntactic treatment of this phenomenon. In a nutshell the idea I am putting forward is that clitic doubling at least in a language like Standard Modern Greek does not have to depend on any special syntactic schema or configuration. Rather-I argue-the clitic is a mere reflection of features of the DP node that is selected by a verbal head that have been copied and moved higher up in the structure. In this light I propose that Clitic Doubling should be seen as a parameterized version of the object Amovement/ A-scrambling-to-the-TP-domain operation as found in a variety of languages.,0
"Head-movement is usually diganosed by consideration of whether there is evidence for displacement of a single-word item. The multimorphemic character of a given form is also often taken to bear on the issue, particularly when the morpheme order mirrors the order of the extended projection in the syntax. However, it is clear that just as there can be head-movement without affixation, there can be affixation without head-movement. Even the issue of which morpheme orders can properly be taken as 'mirroring' the syntax is somewhat more complex in implementation than commonly assumed. In addition to the mirroring options available, additional mechanisms must be at work in deriving certain types of complex forms. An analysis of the Cupeño verbal complex is argued to involve an intricate interplay of independently motivated possibilities. Finally, some of the formal problems posed by the usual head-adjunction analysis of head movement are reviewed, and a brief overview of some alternative theoretical approaches to head-movement is given.",0
"This squib presents an analysis of the morpheme -ko, which is mandatory with adnominal PPs in Basque. In contrast to the traditional analysis of -ko as ""locative genitive"" marker, it is identified as an attributive linker. The linker realises a C-like functional head at the high end of the extended projection of P. It facilitates the adnominal use of the PP, which is assumed to be adjoined to the NP it modifies.

"In this squib, I will discuss one empirical domain where the propositionality and phonetic integrity (isolability) criteria to identify phases fail to capture certain empirical observations (see Chomsky 2000, 2001, 2008). Drawing data from the past transitive structures, aka ergative constructions, in Kurdish, I will demonstrate that the current arguments underlying the determination of the first phase (v*P vs. vP) fall short of accounting for the emergent case/agreement pattern and the cliticization domain in these structures. Instead, a view will be endorsed of the first phase in which a vP constitutes a strong phase only if its head is associated with a full complement of φ-features, regardless of whether an external θ-role is projected in [spec,vP]. Thus construed, the identification of a strong phase need not be procrastinated until the whole vP is formed, rather the status of a phase will be decided once a φ-complete/-defective v° enters into the derivation.",0
"This paper discusses the properties and implications of head movement across a phase boundary. We provide evidence which shows that syntactic phase boundaries correspond to phonological boundaries at the word level.  Analyses of the syntactic and phonological properties of phonologically sub-minimal affixes in Ojibwe, direct and indirect causatives in Malayalam and Malagasy, and alienable versus inalienable possession in Acholi lead us to make the following important claims regarding phases, among others: 1) phase boundaries correspond to event boundaries (or the final boundary at the end of the derivation), similar
to Chomsky's (2001) equation of phases to propositions; we additionally assume a parallel system in the nominal domain and that such phasal demarcations are presumably true of all languages; 2) the phasal distribution of syntactic heads has a direct effect on their phonological behavior; 3) the phase head is included in the Spell-out domain (see Michaels 2009); and 4) head movement out of a phase is possible both before and after Spell-out of that phase, depending on certain structural and featural syntactic characteristics (i.e. only heads that are
phase-adjacent may extract from the phase before Spell-out, and only if they possess the relevant movement-inducing uninterpretable features). We further argue that derivational operations may manipulate constituents that have already undergone Spell-out, but that the phonological effects of such operations are highly constrained.",0
"The distribution of 'for' in English infinitives has for some time been thought to be regulated in large part by its role in assigning syntactic Case to a following overt subject and as such played an important role in the development of Case theory. This paper reconsiders the full range of facts from standard contemporary English, along with a detailed examination of diachronic, dialectal and comparative evidence. The picture that emerges is that a Case-based account is untenable. The clearest parallels to the distribution of 'for' are actually found with that of overt 'that', which is not traditionally thought to be related to Case. The fact that 'for' only appears before overt subjects can then be related to the COMP-trace effect -- which holds for both 'for' and 'that' and essentially rules out an overt complementizer before a silent subject position. The question then is what regulates the overt distribution of complementizers to yield these effects. The later parts of the paper argue that the outlines of the restrictions, in particular the clear relevance of overtness of both the complementizer and what follows it, point toward the relevance of prosodic restrictions. A suggestive proposal along these lines is made, building on An (2007)'s Intonational Phrase Edge Generalization, which places requirements on overt material in the mapping from syntactic structures to prosodic domains.",0
"The focus of this dissertation is the syntax and morphology of case, and how case interacts with A-movement and agreement. In chapter 1, I argue on the basis of novel data from Uyghur that noun phrases bearing structural case can still be eligible for raising. I show that raising in Uyghur is EPP-driven, and does not trigger overt agreement. Thus, we must either conclude that pure EPP movement does not depend on Agree (cf. Richards 2009, a.o.), or abandon the Activity Condition proposed by Chomsky (1998, 2001). I suggest that phenomena that have been attributed to the Activity Condition can be reanalyzed by means of other principles, such as the Phase Impenetrability Condition (Chomsky 1998, 2001).

In chapter 2 (based on joint work with Jeremy Hartman), I argue in favor of Chomsky's (2001) weak version of the Phase Impenetrability Condition, and against Chomsky's (1998) stronger version of the Phase Impenetrability Condition more commonly assumed. The argument is based on case assignment and agreement in n Uyghur genitive subject constructions. I furthermore suggest that adopting Chomsky's (2001) version of the Phase Impenetrability Condition makes the concept of a weak phase head unnecessary (cf. Richards 2009).

In chapter 3, I propose that quirky case in Faroese is not assigned immediately when a noun phrase enters the derivation. Rather, Faroese quirky case depends on a higher functional projection. This helps explain why quirky case-marked noun phrases in Faroese can trigger number agreement and dependent case licensing, and why quirky case can fail to be assigned in Faroese passive and raising constructions.

In chapter 4, I present the results of a study ofmultiple case assignment in Russian Right Node Raising constructions. I show that the morphological system can rule out multiple case assignment when no systematically syncretic form is available, and propose a way of extending Distributed Morphology to capture this phenomenon.",0
"This dissertation focuses on two aspects of expressive affixes: their morphological/typological properties and their semantics. With regard to the former, it shows that the expressive morphology of many languages (including Bantu, West Atlantic, Walman, Sanskrit, English, Romance, Slavic, and others), has the following properties: 1) it is systematically anomalous when compared to plain morphology, or the ordinary processes of word-formation and inflection. From this, it follows that many familiar morphological arguments that adduce the data of expressive morphology ought to be reconsidered; and 2) it is far more pervasive than has been traditionally thought. For example, the Sanskrit preverb, and the Indo-European aspectual prefix/particle generally, are shown to have systematically expressive functions.


With respect to the semantics of expressive affixes, it develops a novel multidimensional account, in the sense of Potts (2005, 2007), of Spanish ""connotative affixes,"" which can simultaneously convey descriptive and expressive meaning. It shows that their descriptive meaning is that of a gradable adjective, viewed as a degree relation which includes a measure function, in the sense of Kennedy (1997). The expressive meanings of connotative affixes, and expressives generally, arise as they manipulate the middle coordinate, I, of expressive indices which, it is proposed, is inherently specified on all lexical items and canonically set to ""neutral."" It introduces a new mechanism, AFF, which is an algebraic operation for manipulating I, and which accounts for the well-known, and seemingly ""contradictory,"" range of meanings that expressive affixes can express. Whereas prior work assumes that expressive affixes are inherently polysemous, this approach derives their many attested meanings and functions (e.g., ""small,"" ""young,"" ""bad,"" deprecation, appreciation, hypocorism, intensification/exactness, and attenuation/approximation, as well as pragmatic effects like illocutionary mitigation) compositionally, from the interactions of their multidimensionality with the meanings of the roots to which they attach.",0
"This article is based on an LSA presentation in 2006 and it aims to identify the copula in Turkish and other Turkic languages. In the literature, including the most recent work on the Turkish copula (Kelepir 2008, and the references therein) the assumption is that there are multiple manifestations of the copula in Turkish, including multiple overt forms and a null one. The empirical and theoretical arguments presented in this article support the claim that is no overt copula in Modern Turkish; the overt form ol „be‟ is either a verb or an auxiliary; the i- in free forms and the -y-in the clitics (of the Counterfactual , Evidential and Conditional inflection) are not a manifestation of the copula, nor an auxiliary. This analysis conforms to the typological properties of Turkic languages.",0
"In this dissertation I argue that auxiliary verbs, particularly auxiliary BE, arise as a reflex of general morphosyntactic processes of verbal inflection, rather than due to arbitrary factors such as syntactic selection. More specifically, I propose that auxiliary verbs reflect a failure of the inflectional system to unite inflectional material with a main verb. This failure occurs when inflectional features are not structurally local to the main verb and are thus ""stranded"". If stranded inflectional features are affixal, they trigger the insertion of a totally default verb (BE) within the morphological component, much as in the traditional analysis of DO-support framed in terms of the Stray Affix Filter (Lasnik, 1981). I frame the structural locality constraints on inflection  in terms of Agree (Chomsky 1998, et seq.), but I adopt a ""reverse"" formulation of Agree in order to allow inflectional feature values to be passed downward from functional heads onto the main verb. This approach contributes to an increasing body of recent work arguing that a ""reversed"" directionality for Agree must be available (Baker 2008, Zeijlstra 2010, Wurmbrand 2011, a.o.). Subsequent chapters extend this general approach into a variety of related domains: the alternation between HAVE and BE in auxiliary selection, the conflict between this analysis of BE and the traditional analysis of DO-support as a process that rescues stranded inflection, and the interaction of verbal inflection and auxiliaries with counterfactual inflection marking.",1
"In this paper, we argue that the conditions on the overtness of subjects and
those governing the distribution of nominative case must be kept logically distinct. In typical nominative-accusative languages, nominative case is not assigned by finite T or by agreement with any functional head. Rather, even in prototypical subject position it is the default case, showing up when the conditions for the assignment of all other cases are not met. The appearance of a dependency is due to a confusion of conditions on nominative case with conditions on the overtness of subjects. Conditions on overtness and case-marking tend to coincide, but a careful look at the data shows that they are orthogonal to each other, and that the latter has more to do with conditions on coreference which in itself is a function of modes of clausal selection and degree of clausal dependency.

"We discuss a type of variation in the pattern of definiteness valuation in Old Romanian (16th to 18th century), which has never been noticed before, and examine its significance for the evolution of the DP. In Old Romanian, the suffixed definite article variably occurs either on the first or on a lower [+N] constituent (noun or adjective), so that an indefinite adjective may precede the definite noun. In contrast, in Modern Romanian, it is always the first noun which bears the definite article, while, in case an adjective precedes the noun, the definite article occurs on the adjective. The existence of this lower (definite) article raises several questions (the contexts where it occurs, its significance for the emergence of the enclitic definite article, etc.), to which this paper provides tentative answers. We propose that the existence of a lower definite article combined with a tendency for economy made possible the extension of the use of the article to (pre-nominal) adjectives, gradually leading to stricter conditions in the valuation of definiteness in Modern Romanian (Local Agree). At the same time, the lower article is evidence that the Romanian enclitic definite article originates in a post-posed demonstrative.",0
"The paper argues that, contrary to claims in the literature (Harley 2005), manner incorporation in the derivation of lexical verbs is syntactically driven, just like result and object incorporation is. The arguments used come from the island effects in non-bridging verbs, regularities in the morphosyntactic behavior of Serbo-Croatian verbs at prefixation and cognate results, objects and manner realization in languages like Serbo-Croatiann, Russian, Hebrew or Vietnamese. In a broader perspective, the paper makes a step towards a general view that all lexical verbs are syntactically derived by incorporation of their arguments, and consequently that all lexical verbs involve a complex syntactic structure.",0
The paper argues for the overspecification approach to syncretism in the domain of Polish super-lexical prefixes and shows how the subset-superset relation that regulates the lexical insertion into non-terminal nodes in syntax allows us to explain why only certain instances of multiple prefixation are attested.,0
"In this paper we will try to outline a quantum theory of the syntax-morphophonology interface, departing from the assumption that the phonological ordering of elements (root and affixes) in a word-level organization is not random but principled, and those principles are third factor principles, which means simplifying the theory in both a substantive and a methodological level. Our framework will be, as usual, Radical Minimalism (Krivochen, 2011a et.seq.), and we will also draw some concepts from physics with the conviction that language is a part of the natural world, and thus it must obey certain basic physical principles. The aforementioned considerations will lead us to review the Agree system once again, refining the concepts we have been using in RM like Collapse and Influence, and their relevance for word-level processes. The objective is a stipulation-free theory of mental faculties, with special focus on language.",1
"This paper argues that case marking applies to PPs, and not to the DPs embedded inside them.

"This paper investigates some cross-linguistic differences in aspectual interpretations of Slavic and Romance languages. We observed that certain readings cannot be determined compositionally from the syntactic representation but instead they result from semantic competition over available morphological representations. We argue that there are certain last resort interpretations, namely, type-shifting and shifts to possible worlds, that may be used to rescue a derivation that would not otherwise be interpretable. Crucially, such a rescue strategy is limited only to some structural environments and is further restricted by economy.",0
"Serial theories of morphology typically assume that morphological structure is phonologically instantiated in a cyclic, inside-out manner. This predicts that suppletive allomorphy of inner material cannot be sensitive to the phonological properties of outer material. The claimed non-existence of such outwards-sensitive allomorph selection has been cited as an argument for a strictly serial approach and against parallel Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky 2004 [1993]), where the form of an entire word is computed at once and hence outwards sensitivity is freely permitted.

In this paper I argue that a purely serial model of allomorph selection cannot be correct, because outwards-sensitivity is not completely unattested. At the same time, the space of attested examples is limited enough that a purely parallel model is clearly under-restrictive. I argue further that the circumstances where outwards phonological sensitivity does become possible are correctly predicted under a version of Optimal Interleaving (Wolf 2008), a theory of phonology-morphology interaction cast within McCarthy's (2007) OT with Candidate Chains. In OT-CC, the grammar constructs a set of harmonically-improving derivations, which compete against one another as candidates. With respect to phonological operations, OT-CC's Local Optimality requirement dictates that changes which violate the same basic faithfulness constraint must compete locally, in the course of chain construction. This paper amends the original version of OI by proposing that Local Optimality for morph-insertion is similar: different morph-insertions must compete locally (are subject to Local Optimality) when they would violate the same (possibly empty) sets of faithfulness constraints on morpheme-morph correspondence. This predicts that local competition is suspended, and thus that outwards sensitivity becomes possible, in cases where one of the competing allomorphs is unfaithful relative to the morphosyntactic input in ways that the other is not. I argue, based on examples from Western Armenian and Kayardild, that this prediction is borne out. I also discuss how phonologically-conditioned allomorphy of roots (which is by definition outwards-looking) can be made sense of in OI.",0
"In this chapter, we look at some possible effects of FOFC below the word level, and at FOFC in relation to the interaction of the word and phrase levels. Although I will not adopt all the details of the Distributed Morphology framework, I will try to follow the leading idea that morphology is ""syntax all the way down"" (Marantz 1997). Specifically, I will adhere as far as possible to the Single Engine Hypothesis, the idea that complex morphological objects (i.e. derived words of various kinds) are constructed in the same way as complex syntactic objects, by the iteration of binary (internal or external) Merge. The principal focus here will be on the extent to which head-movement/incorporation (as well as phrasal movement, see Julien 2002 and below) plays a role in constructing complex words, and how FOFC interacts with these processes. Accordingly the main focus will be on inflectional morphology.
	More specifically, the empirical focus will be a striking typological generalisation regarding suffixing morphology, put forward by Hawkins & Gilligan (1988; henceforth H&G): the suffixing preference. This states that OV/postpositional languages show a strong preference for suffixing, while VO/prepositional languages show no preference among suffixation and prefixation. We will suggest an account of this preference which combines FOFC and the Linear Correspondence Axiom (LCA), and look at some of the ramifications of this.",1
"I examine the lexical approach to parametric variation known as the Borer-Chomsky conjecture (Baker 2008), suggesting that c-selectional features (Pesetsky 1982) can be a locus of such variation, and further, following Julien (2002), that c-selectional movement triggers underlie the distinction between agglutinative and fusional morphology. When combined with Neeleman and Szendrői's (2007) demonstration that radical pro drop (Huang 1984) patterns with agglutination and Biberauer, Holmberg, and Roberts' (2010) restrictions on the distribution of this movement trigger, this derives a binary parameter linking agglutinative pronominal morphology to radical pro drop via c-selection. After surveying such behaviour in the pronouns of six languages, I consider the wh-domain, proposing that wh-structure is based on that of pronouns. Furthermore, Watanabe's (1992a,b) proposal of null wh-operator movement in Japanese is adapted to link agglutinative wh-morphology to wh-in situ, leading to a macroparameter connecting three distinct areas of the grammar. I demonstrate wider empirical support for this macroparameter using The World Atlas of Language Structures Online (Dryer and Haspelmath 2011), and finally, based on data from American Sign Language, suggest that modality may force parametric underspecification. Thus it is demonstrated that even under the Borer-Chomsky conjecture, macroparametric proposals can be made.",0
"In this paper, I argue that the lack of any systematic empirical method yields to serious theoretical problems, and propose an empirical solution:  systematic data collection paired with a theoretical goal to account for all varieties rather than one's own idiolect would resolve the current methodological problems in Turkish linguistics. I present a case study of the Turkish ECM, and data collected within the principles of field work. It also proposes a series of measures that we professionals of the field take to prevent non-systematic data from linguistic analyses. Section (2) discusses the relevant literature on the topic; section (3) discusses Turkish morpho-syntax and its problems with methodology; section (4) presents a case study on the Turkish ECM and proposes answers to the questions posed in (3). Section (5) concludes the discussion.

"In this paper we revisit the classic Hale & Keyser's division between l- and s- syntax, which is still very much present in the form of the categorial / sub-categorial distinction in many Distributed Morphology works. This will lead us to review the problem of roots: their nature, ontology and role in the syntactic derivation; as well as refine the theory about the syntax-semantics interface, departing from a separationist approach: late phonology-early meaning (Cf. Borer, 2009). In order to do so, we will draw on Radical Minimalism (Krivochen, 2011a, b, c) as theoretical background, present its basic tenets and the tools it offers to describe, explain and justify processes confronting them with other current proposals. The ultimate goal is a unified and simple theory of syntax-semantics-morphology ""all the way down"" that, optimally, will eliminate as many stipulations as possible.",0
"Ambiguity is an indisputable and ubiquitous feature of linguistic prod-

Language and we study the emergence of ambiguity in communication
through the concept of logical irreversibility and within the framework
of Shannon's information theory. This leads us to a precise and general
expression of the intuition behind Zipf's vocabulary balance in terms of a
symmetry equation between the complexities of the coding and the decod-
ing processes that imposes an unavoidable amount of logical uncertainty in
natural communication. Accordingly, the emergence of irreversible com-

"The object of this article is to provide a thorough analysis of the little studied kiss goodbye construction (Max kissed his mother goodbye).

This work belongs to the Chomskian tradition, which aims at accounting for the properties of specific constructions as the result of the articulation of the various grammatical processes that produce them, which means that it should shed light on the resultative construction itself, if it is right that the kiss goodbye construction is a particular instance of it.",0
"In recent times, there has arisen an overbearing need to describe, analyse and document the various languages of the world. This research investigates aspects of the grammar of Kusaal – a less familiar, un-described and under-studied Mabia (Gur) language spoken in the north-eastern corner of Ghana by some 450,000 people. The study entails a description of the phonology of the language and is concerned with uncovering the underlying sounds, the syllable structures, the phonological processes and the tonal patterns inherent in Kusaal. It is cast within the generative phonological traditions especially formalised by Chomsky and Halle (1968), on Goldsmith‟s (1979, 1990) autosegmental phonology and on moraic theory. Data for the research was collected with an electronic recorder from twelve respondents on a field trip to Bawku and Zebilla. The data was then used in corroboration with other sources found in a few study materials. Native speaker intuition and the Praat acoustics software were important resources in the transcription, description and analyses of the data. The study reveals that Kusaal has twenty-four consonants, nine short vowels which have long correlates, five nasal vowels which are all [-ATR] and several sequences of vowels. The study also shows that the various syllable structures of the language are collapsible into four predominant types: the peak only, the VC, CV and the CVC. Kusaal is morphologically isolating but words can take up to four syllables of different structures and types in the language. Two phonological processes are identified in the language: assimilation and syllable structure processes. In the former, nasalisation, homorganic nasal assimilation, labialisation, palatalisation and vowel harmony are prevalent while the latter manifests in syllable deletion and truncation, aspiration, glottalisation and loanword re-syllabification. Kusaal is a register tone language which distinguishes three level tones – high, mid and low. It also distinguishes a downstepped high from an underlying high tone. The study identifies the mora as the tone bearing unit and discusses the role of tone in the morphosyntax of the language.",0
"The so-called New Passive in Icelandic takes the form it was elected us (or e.g. then was elected us, without an expletive), instead of the standard we were elected. It has neither A-movement to subject nor ACC-to-NOM conversion, otherwise diagnostic of the canonical passive in Icelandic and related languages. Some researchers have argued that passive is in fact a misnomer and that the construction should instead be analyzed as an active one, with a nominative pro. This paper argues instead in favor of a minimalist analysis, where the New Passive is closely related to the impersonal P-passive (with a PP, type then was shouted at us), which is highly common and productive in Icelandic. On the approach pursued, ACC-to-NOM conversion involves case-star deletion, absent from the New Passive (much as from so-called psych and fate (un)accusatives in standard Icelandic). In addition, the New Passive has a strong vP phase edge, blocking A-movement, in contrast to the defective vP edge in the canonical passive. The paper argues that A-grounding or freezing is brought about by -minimality, A-islands thus arising in a parallel fashion as A'-islands.",0
"The principle of compositionality says that the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its parts and how they are put together. What are the ""parts""? This question can be asked in many ways. Today's question: Are phonological words the smallest parts that a compositional grammar should take into account? A number of theories suggest that phonological words are not distinguished building blocks in syntax or morphology. I point out a set of cases where recognizing sub-word compositionality in the interpretation of quantifiers seems illuminating, but also raises challenging questions.",0
"This paper deals with the following weird, and interesting construction in Tamil: 





Raman taan school-ukku poo.r.een-nnu so.nn.aan 



Raman SE school-DAT   go.PRES.1sg-that say.PST.3msg 



""Raman said that he (Raman) is going to school."" 





 The matrix subject is 3rd person, masculine, and singular; the matrix verb denotes a speech-report and agrees in phi-features with the matrix subject. The embedded clausal complement contains a subject which has traditionally been described as a SE-anaphor (marked 3rd singular) which is obligatorily coreferent with the matrix subject. But the embedded verb which should agree with its clausemate subject (taan) shows up, not as 3rd-person masculine (or even with default agreement which, in Tamil, would be 3rd-person neuter) but with 1st-person singular agreement marking. Crucially and tellingly, such mismatched verbal agreement only shows up with matrix speech-event denoting verbs like ""say""; with all other verbs that take clausal complements, we get the expected 3rd person masculine agreement on the embedded verb. The focus of the paper is to investigate why this kind of agreement mismatch obtains. I argue that the 1st person singular agreement is actually due to indexical shift -- a phenomenon wherein an indexical (like ""I"") refers, not to the speaker/author of the utterance context, but to the speaker/author of the context denoted by the speech-event (in the example above, the speech-event is the event of saying and its author is the individual denoted by the matrix subjec, Raman). I term the 1sg agreement on the embedded verb ""monstrous agreement"", in line with the Kaplanian tradition of referring to (context-)shifted indexicals as ""monsters"".",0
"This thesis is an investigation into the primitives of syntax. More specifically, it focuses on two domains: the lexical projection and categorial features. Analogously, it consists of two parts. The first part argues that the features of lexical vocabulary items are not an active part of the syntactic derivation (cf. Borer 2005). I provide empirical support for the claim that vocabulary items are not present in syntax. Consequently, lexical nodes canot be defined through the merger of a lexical vocabulary item. Furthermore, lexical vocabulary items cannot determine the (sub)category of the projection. Instead, this dissertation adopts the view that syntax operates on UG-features only. It argues that the root terminal node is a by-product of the operation Merge that is characterized by the mere absence of features (cf. De Belder & van Craenenbroeck 2011). It further shows that functional structure determines subcategories. In the second part of the thesis I argue against the existence of categorial heads. It is generally assumed that derivational affixes realize categorial heads (see for example Marchand 1969, Williams 1981, Selkirk 1982 and Halle and Marantz 1993, amongst many others). I argue against this view and propose instead that derivational affixes realize root positions. I show that the meaning of derivational affixes is lexical and hence propose to treat them as lexical rather than functional vocabulary items. Furthermore, I show that the same descriptive and explanatory adequacy can be obtained without postulating categorial heads. The conclusion of both parts is that lexical categorial features are no longer a primitive of syntax. This work can be situated both in Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1997) and the Exo-Skeletal Model (Borer 2005).",0
"In Czech, complements of static locative prepositions appear in a bewildering variety of cases (acc, gen, loc or ins). Building on previous work (Emonds, Zwarts, Gehrke), I show that there is a rigid system underlying the surface diversity based on notions such as projectivity, dimensionality, etc. I argue that this underlying system is related to the morphology of case in an interesting way, such that semantically more complex cases correspond to morphologically more complex cases. I suggest that such a correlation gives grounds to believe that case morphology should be part of syntax proper.",0
"Roots and their categorization constitute a fundamental aspect of knowledge about the structure of language. Essentially, the categorization of roots serves to classify linguistic information. In this dissertation I explore the categorization of roots in Blackfoot (Algonquian) and Lithuanian (Baltic), languages which are unrelated typologically or genetically. 
 Relying on the interaction between roots and affixes, I develop language specific diagnostics necessary to establish the categorial affiliation of a given root. I show that all Blackfoot roots are uniquely associated with a particular category, i.e. they are categorized. Meanwhile, Lithuanian roots split into two types: some are categorized, and some are category-neutral. This variation in the categorization of roots requires an explanation. 
 I propose that the categorial destiny of a root is determined by (i) a category intrinsic feature c (such as e.g., animacy, gender, transitivity, and degree); and (ii) the categorization structure hosting the feature c. 
 There are two sources of variation: i) the origin of the feature c; and ii) the content of the feature c. Roots that are endowed with the feature c prior to syntax are of a unique category; roots that attain their feature c in syntax are category-neutral. In addition, the content of feature c may differ across languages. 
 According to this proposal, the notion of category is not a primitive but a construct.",1
"In my thesis, I investigate directional expressions cross-linguistically. I examine the morpho-syntactic structure of expressions of Goal (to the house), Source (from the house), Route (through the house), as well as path expressions of the type up to the house and away from the house. I develop a fine-grained path typology comprising eight different types of paths and conclude that they have different complexity. Precisely, Source expressions are formed on the basis of Goal expressions, Route expressions are formed on the basis of Source expressions. Similarly, paths without transitions (towards, away from) are formed on the basis of the corresponding transitional path (to, from) and paths with delimitation (up tom starting from) are formed on the basis of the corresponding ""ordinary"" Goal or Source path.

Assuming that morphological complexity is reflected in syntax, I take this containment relationship to indicate that the syntactic structure of Route expressions embeds the structure of Source expressions, which embed Goal expressions. Similarly, non-transitional and delimited paths embed the corresponding transitional path. This leads me to decomposing the Path head, argued to be present in directional phrases, into five distinct heads: Goal, Source, Route, Scale and Bound. I propose a semantic function for each particular head.

I explore the lexicalization of the decomposed Path structure and show how it captures the
morphological make-up and diversity of directional expressions across languages, as well as the
restrictions which apply to them. In this, I follow the Nanosyntax framework and develop an idea
recently put forward by M. Starke that the entries stored in the lexicon can trigger syntactic movements
in order for Spell-out to take place. 

In the final part of the thesis, I investigate the various predictions made by the decomposed path structure and the lexicalization theory I assume. Specifically, I explore the possible and impossible
lexicalization patterns and syncretisms between the various spatial roles and show that the system
correctly captures the attested ones and bans the unattested ones.",0

"A central question regarding the syntax-semantics interface is the extent to which semantic primitives correspond one-to-one with syntactic primitives. Den Dikken (1995) proposed that all possession structures can be derived from an underlying locative structure, extending the work of Freeze (1992). This paper argues that such a uniﬁed approach is untenable, as there are possession expressions in Icelandic which cannot be derived from locative structures. The Icelandic 'vera með' construction, translated as 'is with', provides important insight into the nature of HAVE verbs. It is argued, along the lines of Kayne (1993) and Harley (2002), that HAVE is derived from non-locative prepositions like English 'with' as in 'The man with blue eyes'. A micro-comparative investigation within Germanic supports an analysis whereby the variation in incorporation is correlated with variations in p heads. This analysis allows for a more natural account of the differences between HAVE and BE languages beyond Germanic.",0
"The two extant approaches to reduplication in Distributed Morphology (DM) are: (i) the readjustment approach, where reduplication is claimed to result from a readjustment operation on some stem triggered by a (typically null) affix; and (ii) the affixation approach, where  reduplication is claimed to result from the insertion of a special type of Vocabulary Item (i.e. a reduplicative affix-""reduplicant"" or ""Red"") which gets inserted into a syntactic node in order to discharge some morphosyntactic feature(s), but which receives its own phonological content from some other stem (i.e. its ""base"") in the output. This paper argues from phonologically-conditioned allomorphy pertaining to base-dependence, as in the case of durative reduplication in Tawala, that the latter approach best accounts for a necessary distinction between ""reduplicants"" and ""bases"" as different types of morphemes which display different phonological effects, including ""the emergence of the unmarked"" effects, in many languages.  I also defend a blended model of DM which incorporates a constraint-based Correspondence Theoretic vision of Phonological Form. In this model the syntax builds morphological structure as per standard DM assumptions, which in turn leads to local and cyclic restrictions on allomorph selection, as argued in Embick 2010.  I argue contra Embick 2010, however, that the phonology must be an essential part of the grammar in order to account for surface form-oriented (or ""output-centered"") prosodic morphology such as reduplication and mora affixation. The output of Morphological Structure thus serves as an input into PF, which I construe as Optimality Theoretic tableaux as in Correspondence Theory, thus accounting for surface-oriented phonological copying effects like base-dependence.",1
"In this chapter, I motivate a new approach to the derivation of structure and its labeling. I do this by removing a stipulation from the definition of Merge, and by replacing functional categories qua lexical items with a function that directly labels structures. The removal of the stipulation in Merge allows unary branching structures which, in the new system, provide the structural carapace for sequences of (mainly functional)  categories; the labeling function recurses from the categories assigned to roots, assigning labels to ever larger structures on the basis of a universally given sequence of  categories (Cinque 1999, Starke (2001), obviating the need for functional heads. Unary branching labeled structures provide the locus for morphological realization so that what were previously considered to be functional lexical items are, in the new system, just spellouts of pieces of labeled structure. Standard binary Merge then provides the further structure necessary for negotiating the syntactic and semantic connections between sequences of categories. Part of the motivation for setting up the system in this way is that it provides us with a solution to a serious problem in the derivation of current phrase structural representations: how structures containing base generated specifiers are labeled. However, the system I develop also rules out a certain class of rollup and remnant movement analyses, replacing them with base generated `flipped' structures (Brody 2000, Adger Habour and Watkins 2009), reducing the analytical options available to syntactic structure building in a desirable way.",0
"One of the puzzling aspects of the Berber languages is the nature of the construct state and the cooccurrence restrictions it undergoes with certain grammatical morphemes. In particular, the reason why the construct state marker w- never occurs with the gender marker t- remains unclear, despite of several studies mostly syntactic. This paper argues that the construct state marker w- and the feminine marker t- compete for the same templatic position. Within the standard DP projection, it is proposed that a templatic CV site hosts gender t- under the nP. When raised to D, this site has no C position available for the construct state w-, yielding forms where only the feminine marker is realized. The same reasoning holds in the causative imperfective formations. The association of the causative prefix with the templatic site under the vP explains the absence of aspect markers in the verb. Extended to the case of Classical Arabic verb conjugation, the competition hypothesis allows us to explain why reflexive n- never co-occurs with medial consonant gemination; though semantically viable, nkassara 'it shuttered' is ruled out because reflexive n-, generated lower in the structure than intensive gemination, fills the only C position provided by the derivational CV. The advocated analysis has implications for the way syntax, morphology and phonology interact: templates are indeed argued to mediate the interaction between components of Grammar. Handled in syntactic structure, templates allow unifying standard phonological, morphological and syntactic accounts of the co-occurrence restrictions examined in this paper.",0
"Roots have been argued to be (a) devoid of grammatical features, (b) categoryless, (c) structurally defined, and (d) dominated byrather than dominatingfunctional material (see among others Halle and Marantz 1993, Borer 2005a, 2005b, 2009a, 2009b). We show that these four properties follow straightforwardly from the theory of Merge. Adopting and adapting ideas from Jaspers (1998), Fortuny (2008), and Zwart (2009a, 2009b, 2010), we argue that Merge is inherently asymmetric, and that the first merge operation in each (sub)derivationcalled Primary Merge herecombines an element from the vocabulary inventory with the null derivation. At the level of Vocabulary Insertion, this null derivation serves as the insertion site for roots. In addition, the proposal outlined here allows us to formulate a vocabulary insertion mechanism that treats functional terminal nodes and root terminal nodes alike, and it leads to a model of the grammar in which derivations proceed left-to-right across cyclic domains, but bottom-up within each cyclic domain (cf. Uriagereka 1999).",1
"In this article, I first briefly exemplify a number of morphological phenomena which have syntactic repercussions, to illustrate the range of issues investigators confront. I then sketch a variety of grammatical architectures and their general approach to the interaction between morphology and syntax, paying attention to what empirical territory is considered the domain of independent morphological processes vs. the domain of properly syntactic processes in each. Finally, I provide a more in-depth look at the theory of the morphosyntactic interface with which I am most familiar, Distributed Morphology, and briefly describe specific problems associated with syntacticocentric approaches to derivational morphology at the interface.",0
"In this paper I argue that implicit indefinite objects, i.e., the notional objects of intransitive uses of verbs like 'eat', 'bake', 'smoke', 'drink', 'read', 'write', etc., are represented grammatically as null, bare, number-unmarked nouns. The relationship between the null noun and the verb it is the notional object of is just like the relationship between the noun and the verb in what I call Noun-Verb verbs, produced as a result of processes such as noun incorporation, noun stripping or denominal verb formation. The argument is based on the semantic similarities between implicit indefinite objects and the nouns in these other constructions. The results of this research are important not only from a linguistic perspective, but from a philosophy of language perspective as well, as implicit indefinite objects have been taken to constitute evidence for the existence of pragmatic enrichment, a claim that is argued against here.",0
"This paper undertakes a detailed comparison of the properties of derived nominals with ing with the properties of ing Synthetic Compounds.  Focusing on the presence of event structure and obligatory compositionality for the former, vs. the absence of both for the latter, it shows that an adequate account for these surprising contrasts may only be obtained by adopting a syntactic approach to the derivation of complex words.",0
"The paper discusses dative cliticization patterns in Modern Greek in passives and unaccusatives. Based on cross-linguistic evidence, I demonstrate that dative cliticization is never implicated in MLC-violating movement operations (contra Anagnostopoulou 2003). Instead, discourse-insensitive dative cliticization exhaustively reduces to the effects of a generalized Doubly filled Comp Filter. The paper highlights the reality of head movement as a syntactic operation and illustrates a tight interaction at the syntax-morphology interface.",0
"This paper investigates the semantics of derived statives, deverbal adjectives that fail to 

entail there to have been a preceding (temporal) event of the kind named by the verb they 

are derived from, e.g.darkened in a darkened portion of skin. Building on Gawrons (2009) 

recent observations regarding the semantics of extent uses of change of state verbs (e.g., 

Kims skin darkens between the knee and the calf) and Kennedy and Levins (2008) theory 

of change, it is shown, contrary to previous analyses, that a fully compositional semantic 

analysis is possible, and thus that there is no argument from derived statives for word 

formation differing from semantic composition above the word level in requiring deletion 

operations, as in Dubinsky and Simangos (1996) analysis. Further, such an analysis, by 

contrast with previous ones, both compositional (Jackson 2005b; Condoravdi and Deo 2008) 

and non-compositional (Dubinsky and Simango 1996), correctly predicts, as shown by a 

range of arguments, that the meaning of the derived stative contains the meaning of the 

verb it is derived from and that it therefore contrasts fundamentally with morphologically 

simple adjectives in the kind of meaning that it has.",0
"One of the challenges in linguistics is how to account for expected patterns of argument realisation, possibly associated with certain classes of verbs and their morphology, within or across languages. Such patterns include passivisation,'spray-load'alternations and transitive-intransitive alternations. Consider the following passivisation in English (1) and Indonesian (2).(1). a. The people elect the president. b. The president is elected (by the people).(2). a. Anjing itu mengejar kucing itu.(Indonesian) dog that AV. chase cat that 'The dog chased the cat.'b. Kucing itu dikejar (oleh anjing itu). cat that DI-chase by dog that 'The cast was chased by the dog.'One of the important characteristics of passivisation illustrated by (1) and (2) is that passivisation changes the syntactic status of the agent and patient arguments. The agent in the active voice in the (a) sentences is the syntactic subject, coming preverbally. It becomes an (optional) oblique in the passive (b) counterparts. Passivisation in these two languages is also marked morphologically on the verb, eg by–ed (past participle) in English and di-in Indonesian.",0
"Breton tensed verbs show an synthetic/analytic structure alternation (I.know vs. to.know I.do), that is not conditioned by their semantic or aspectual structure but by their syntactic environment, namely word order. Such a paradigm of
verb-doubling poses a strong case against iconicity, because knowing where a verb can double requires full information about the entire derivation of the sentence. The sentence is correct if and only if the tensed element is not at the left-edge of the sentence. The infinitive form of the analytic construction prevents the tensed element from occurring in the most left-edge position. This paper proposes that the analytic structure (to.know I.do) responds to the same trigger as expletive insertion (expl I.know). I claim that analytic tense formation is a
last-resort strategy that forms the equivalent of an expletive by excorporation of the verbal root out of the complex tensed head. The excorporated lexical verb appears fronted as an infinitive form by default. The tensed auxiliary is either realized as a dummy 'do' auxiliary (to.know I.do), or, for an idiosyncratic list of verbs, as the tensed reiteration of the excorporated verb itself (doubling; to.know I.know).",0
"As often noticed, Romanian has both genitive personal pronouns and possessive adjectives, forms with pronominal meaning and adjectival agreement. Possessive adjectives have always represented a theoretical difficulty through their paradoxical adjectival and pronominal properties. The aim of the paper is to propose an account of this possessive paradox, starting from a more detailed presentation of Romanian data, against the background of recent minimalist theory (Baker & Vinokurova 2010, Chomsky 2000, 2001, 2009, Pesetsky & Torrego 2007). The analysis will briefly be extended to French.

The analysis starts from the obvious empirical fact that possessive adjectives alternate with nominal or pronominal Genitives in realizing Possessors and other arguments of nouns, and pursues the intuition that arguments of nouns undergo adjectivization in contexts where the Genitive as a structural case cannot be licensed. Adjectivization and the assignment of the Genitive case are alternative means of showing the syntactic dependence of one DP (the argument) on another (the head). Possessive adjectives are viewed as mixed categories, specifically, derivationally created adjectivized DPs. Adjectivization by-passes the problem of Case licensing, since adjectives do not need case and may share the case of the noun they modify. In licensing a possessive adjective, it is essential that the possessed NP and the Possessor DP find themselves in a sufficiently local configuration permitting agreement (feature sharing).",0
"Ditransitive verbs in Japanese allow both the IO-O-V order and the O-IO-V order. Hoji (1985) argued  quite convincingly based on what we knew at the time  that the first word order (IO-O) is basic, and the second (O-IO) is derived by scrambling the O over IO. This is the single-base analysis of ditransitive verbs. In Miyagawa (1997) and Miyagawa and Tsujioka (2004), instead of the single-base analysis of Hoji, arguments are given for a dual-base analysis of ditransitives. I will give further evidence for the dual-base analysis based on nominalization, building on the important work by Kishimoto (2006). What we can see in Japanese helps us to understand the right approach to the nominalization facts in other languages where differences have been detected between the two argument structures, showing that Pesetskys (1995) approach based on Myers Generalization makes the right prediction with regard to not only the similarities between English and Japanese, but also one sharp difference between the two languages.",0
"This book surveys research in quantification starting with the foundational work in the 1970s. It paints a vivid picture of generalized quantifiers and Boolean semantics. It explains how the discovery of diverse scope behavior in the 1990s transformed the view of quantification, and how the study of the internal composition of quantifiers has become central in recent years. It presents different approaches to the same problems, and links modern logic and formal semantics to advances in generative syntax. A unique feature of the book is that it systematically brings cross-linguistic data to bear on the theoretical
issues, discussing French, German, Dutch, Hungarian, Russian, Japanese, Telugu (Dravidian), and Shupamem (Grassfield Bantu), and pointing to formal semantic literature involving quantification in around thirty languages. [Introduction and Table of Contents posted here.]",0
"This paper analyzes the morphology and syntax of wh expressions and agreeing complementizers in Wolof, an Atlantic language of Senegal.  I argue that Wolof possesses a set of null wh expressions in addition to a set of overt wh expressions.  The null wh expressions occur in a relative clause-like construction in which they trigger agreement on a complementizer.  I examine the properties of the null wh's and compare them to the overt wh's in Wolof.  I provide evidence that the null wh's, like the overt wh's, move successive cyclically and may trigger agreement on intermediate complementizers that occur in the movement pathway.  I also compare the Wolof construction to a superficially similar complementizer agreement construction in the Bantu language Kinande, null operators in German, and wh drop in Dutch.",0
"This paper proposes a new analysis of the crossed-control construction in Standard Indonesian first observed in Gil (2002) and recently analyzed in Polinsky and Potsdam (2008) and Nomoto (2008, To appear). Indonesian verbs of desire, mau/ingin want, behave like ordinary subject control constructions but when they embed a passive complement, they exhibit a crossed-reading which involves an unusual alignment between the predicates and their arguments. Specifically, the matrix surface subject is thematically related to the embedded predicate whereas the subordinate oblique phrase is construed as the agent of the matrix control predicate. I propose that this reading arises because the passive morpheme di-, clitic-doubled with a third person oblique agentive phrase, undergoes syntactic incorporation into the matrix control predicate. The present analysis allows for a straightforward explanation of a wide variety of other facts, including 1) the presence of the crossed-reading in a different type of passive commonly known as zero passives, 2) the absence of the crossed reading in an active complement headed by the active voice marker meN-, and 3) the unavailability of the crossed-reading in the corresponding control constructions in languages such as English.",0
"This paper classifies the typology of morphological dissimilation effects into four distinct stages of the mapping from syntax to exponence: linearization, initial prosodic phrasing, M-Word formation, and allomorph selection, in that order. Each module has its own properties, structure-sensitivities, and suite of potential repair operations; for example, the earliest stage is insensitive to adjacency and phonological form, while the latest stage is sensitive to strict adjacency and aspects of phonological form. A modular architecture for exponence allows one to distinguish the properties of each type of dissimilation, thereby enabling predictive correlations between structural sensitivity and possible repair.",0
"This paper capitalizes on the difference between person complementarity (e.g. PCC effects) and om- nivorous number (e.g. the fact that a single plural marker can be used to cross-reference more than one plural argument) by proposing that the same syntactic mechanism of Multiple Agree is responsible for both. The widely divergent surface difference results from the fact that person features are fully binary, whereas number features are syntactically privative. Additionally, arguments drawn from a variety of verbal cross-referencing morphemes im- plicating phi-interactions between subject and object support the claim that these elements are clitics, necessitating a revisitiation of the clitic-affix distinction.",0
"The paper presents a novel analysis of verb prefixation of the Slavic type, based on the data from Serbo-Croatian. It is argued that the semantic effects of prefixes, their morpho-syntactic behavior and the asymmetries between the so-called external and internal prefixes are best captured by an analysis based on multiple relativization. A counterpart of the raising analysis of multiple relatives is formulated in the verbal domain, where aspectual relative clauses modify the highest aspectual head, and head movement of the aspect head triggers agreement between the bounder (PP specifying the bounds that induce telicity) and the lexical verb that head moves. This agreement is marked by prefixes, which therefore correspond to the respective prepositions. The analysis has a wider empirical coverage than its predecessors, but it also contributes to some more general theoretical claims: that all the type recursion in language stems from relativization, that relativization is a general syntactic strategy which parametrically occurs in different categorial domains, and that lexical verbs, just like lexical nouns (hence open classes in general) do not take complements.",0
"This paper argues that recursion is a function of reasoning and discourse that individual languages may or may not choose to use in their (nondiscourse) grammars. Determining complexity of languages must take discourse into account. By this measure, Piraha does have recursion in the discourse. But not in the grammar, as that term is understood in formal linguistics. Some of this paper has appeared in earlier drafts. Most of it is new.",0
"What are linguistic features, and how do they manifest themselves in natural languages? The Georgian language provides a particularly acute set of challenges to linguists in the way it questions received assumptions about grammatical functions, thematic relations, and natural language categorization.  

This dissertation tackles these facts by examining first what the evidence for different domains of grammar are in Georgian. How do data from Georgian verb morphology challenge traditional assumptions underlying lexical incremental assumptions behind the morpheme? Do inversion facts argue for monostratal or multistratal conceptualizations of grammatical functions? 

The answer to both of these questions is highly complicated, and requires an extensive look at the Georgian systems of case, agreement, tense, aspect, and modality.  In particular I assess the viability of classical treatments such as Harris (1982), Anderson (1993), Marantz (1992), and Stump (2001) and find that Georgian poses problems for each one.  I go on to assess in the second part how differential feature hierarchies in morphology versus syntax argue for the existence of distinct feature geometries.  Feature hierarchies, it turns out, are epiphenomena of set-theoretical properties of these geometries.  In the last chapter, I discuss the literature on feature hierarchies arguing how many scholars have misunderstood this highly abstract area of grammatical theorizing.",0

"The paper argues that syntactic doubling is a core property of syntax required to express monadic and dyadic predication. Much of syntactic doubling does not surface, because syntactic doubling introduces local (feature) redundancy that triggers a process of partial or full deletion. This set of assumptions is demonstrated to explain the complex patterns of variation found in Dutch focus particle doubling.",0
"Do the production and interpretation of patterns of plural forms in noun-noun compounds reveal the workings of innate constraints that govern morphological processing? The results of previous studies on compounding have been taken to support a number of important theoretical claims: ﬁrst, that there are fundamental differences in the way that children and adults learn and process regular and irregular plurals, second, that these differences reﬂect formal constraints that govern the way the way regular and irregular plurals are processed in language, and third, that these constraints are unlikely to be the product of learning. In a series of seven experiments, we critically assess the evidence that is cited in support of these arguments. The results of our experiments provide little support for the idea that substantively different factors govern the patterns of acquisition, production and interpretation patterns of regular and irregular plural forms in compounds. Once frequency differences between regular and irregular plurals are accounted for, we ﬁnd no evidence of any qualitative difference in the patterns of interpretation and production of regular and irregular plural nouns in compounds, in either adults or children.  Accordingly, we suggest that the pattern of acquisition of both regular and irregular plurals in compounds is consistent with a simple account, in which children learn the conventions that govern plural compounding using evidence that is readily available in the distribution patterns of adult speech.",0
"The Multiple Spell-Out model of Chomsky (2000, 2001, 2004) and Uriagereka (1999) provides a straightforward characterization of the syntactic environments for contraction. It is well known that wanna-contraction is possible in the subject control case (Who do you wanna marry?) but blocked in the DP + infinitival case (*Who do you wanna marry you?). This asymmetry receives a straightforward account if the CP phase boundary demarcates the domain for contraction. More complex cases of contraction discussed by Postal and Pullum (1978, 1982) fall into place if left-branching structures form a self-contained Spelled-Out domain as in Uriagerekas model. The analysis can also derive a number of well-known generalizations regarding auxiliary reduction such as a) the invisibility of a Case-marked trace for reduction and b) the inhibitory effect of the gap on reduction. a) is a natural consequence of the TP-analysis for that-less finite complements whereas b) is the result of the tight interaction between the syntactic system and the fine-grained prosodic classification of function words developed by Selkirk (1995). Particular details of the analysis support various principles of syntax such as the Economy of Projection and the notion of CP phase. This paper, therefore, achieves the minimalist desideratum of explaining linguistic phenomena solely in terms of interface conditions and computational efficiency.",0
"This paper provides a formal analysis of the syntax of wh-questions in Colloquial Singapore English and identifies the language that must have played a substantial role in the genesis and development of wh-questions in this variety. This variety has three options for wh-questions: full movement into the operator position, partial movement into an intermediate position and in-situ. Contrary to the dominant view that the primary substrate languages of CSE are (southern) Chinese languages (i.e. Mandarin, Cantonese, and Hokkien), these languages have not exerted any substratist influence on the syntax of wh-questions in CSE. Instead, the range of options for wh-questions attested arises from intense language contact between Singapore Malay and this variety. Specifically, following Cole and Hermon‟s (1998) analysis of the typology of wh-questions, I suggest that the substratist transfer took the form of a lexico-syntactic parameterization: an operator is either combined in a single word with a wh-variable or base-generated directly in the scopal operator position, unselectively binding the wh-variable. This analysis correctly predicts a wide range of other syntactic and semantic parallelisms between wh-questions in Singapore Malay and CSE. This result suggests that Singapore Malay is the primary substratal language of CSE with respect to wh-questions.",0
"Previously two-letter roots were looked for mostly by examining similarities in the perceived intuitive meaning of Hebrew words, an approach which didnt lead to significant success.

"There is a basic asymmetry between arguments and verbs when it comes to the semantics of φ-features. Person, number and gender are notions that bear on the interpretation of arguments, but not on the interpretation of verbs. The question that this phenomenon poses is whether the interpretive asymmetry is reflected in syntax. Many theories of agreement assume that this is indeed the case (Chomsky 2000, 2001, Frampton and Gutmann 2000, Pesetsky and Torrego 2007, and Bobaljik 2007). Other theories of agreement, such as the unification-based theories employed in LFG and HPSG, assume that there is no syntactic asymmetry between nominal and verbal φ-features. We will argue in favour of this alternative view, basing our argument on the phenomenon of what we will call subset controllers. These are arguments that at least at face value are specified for fewer φ-features than the verb that agrees with them. The case we will look at in detail is Spanish unagreement.",0
"This article explores the way in which the prosodic properties of words can be predicted from independent principles relating structures with phonology. In the literature, the general assumption is that the linear position of an affix determines whether it phonologically integrates with the base or not: prefixes do not integrate, and suffixes do, unless they are independent phonological words. Here we will argue in favour of an alternative account where, just as in syntactic phrases, the phonological properties follow from the internal constituency of words. We propose that, independently of their linear position with respect to the base, an affix is phonologically independent from it when they do not belong to the same Command Unit (CU). Phonological integration between base and affix takes place when both elements are inside the same CU. This proposal is argued for on the basis of the behaviour of diminutive affixes in Spanish, German and Czech. The results obtained from this analysis are applied to the domain of parasynthetic verbs in Spanish, in order to evaluate the plausibility of a particular proposal about their internal constituency.",0

"In this dissertation I put forth a syntactic theory of argument structure and the syntax-morphology interface and I apply it mainly to Early and Classical Latin, although comparison with other languages and discussion of the facts in these languages is conceded a considerable weight. I argue for a view of argument structure where a basic distinction is drawn between the elements carrying encyclopaedic content, the roots, and the syntactic configuration built around functional heads. Argument structure properties exclusively depend on the latter. Furthermore, the syntactic configuration provides the structural semantics of the linguistic expression. I endorse a theory of the syntax-morphology interface like the one proposed in the Distributed Morphology framework: some specific PF operations can disrupt the basic syntax-morphology isomorphism, and cross-linguistic variation shall be defended to depend exclusively on that possible lack of isomorphism between syntax and morphology. The empirical focus is set on the domain of events expressing a transition. I consider Talmys (2000) theory of the cross-linguistic expression of events of change, where a basic divide is drawn between the languages in which the transition can be encoded by a non-verbal element satellite-framed languages and the languages in which the transition cannot be encoded by a non-verbal element verb-framed languages. I couch Talmys theory of transition events within a syntactic theory of argument structure, and I explore a wide range of constructions in Latin either presenting new data or giving a new perspective on data from the Latin linguistics traditionshowing that Latin pertains to the class of satellite-framed languages. Following an idea in Mateu (2002:160) and Mateu & Rigau (2002), I propose that the satellite-/verb-framed distinction is explainable in purely morphophonological terms. In particular, I make use of the theory of PF operations developed by Embick & Noyer (1999, 2001) within the Distributed Morphology framework, together with Hale & Keysers (2002:60f.) and Harleys (2004) theory of conflation, to account for the distinction. Thus, in verb-framed languages the eventive v head lowers, at PF, to the head encoding transition Path and fuses with it, yielding a unique locus for phonological realisation. On the other hand, in satellite-framed languages this Fusion operation does not take place, so v and Path are free to be phonologically realised independently from each other. Finally, I propose a refinement of Talmys typology within the class of satellite-framed languages. First, there are strong satellite-framed languages, like the Germanic languages, where v and Path are not required to form one word, and, thus, allow constructions like adjectival resultative constructions. Second, there are weak satellite-framed languages, like Latin, where v and Path must form one word (if both are realised independently from each other) and disallow, hence, constructions like adjectival resultative constructions. This distinction is accounted for in terms of a v-to-Path (PF) Lowering operation for weak satellite-framed languages, which creates a complex head. A three-way, gradual typology emerges encompassing strong satellite-framed languages (no v-to-Path Lowering and no v-Path Fusion), weak satellite-framed languages (v-to-Path Lowering, no v-Path Fusion) and verb-framed languages (v-to-Path Lowering and v-Path Fusion).",0
"I investigate a Breton paradigm where excorporation takes place from

morphological amalgams such as inflected lexical verbs. I propose that Breton

analytic structures with auxiliation in do illustrate a case of excorporation

outside of syntax, in realizational morphology. The distribution of Breton

excorporation is directly dependent on the output of the syntactic module : word

order. The trigger for excorporation, Late Expletive Insertion Trigger, is itself at the interface, after syntax and before phonology. 

Excorporation out of the inflected head asks for repair strategies in order to pass the Stray Affix Filter : do support insertion leads to regular analytic structures in do (to.know do.1SG, I know). 

Another last resort strategy is to pronounce the lower copy of the lexical verb, which leads to doubling structures (to.know know.1SG, I know). 

Idiosyncrasy of the latter confirms that repairs of excorporation are not syntactic.",0
"This article discusses the absence of reflexive or self-caused readings in certain types of de-verbal nominalizations and participles, like ""the hanging of the suicidal patient"" and  ""The suicidal patient was hanged yesterday"". I argue that the ``anti-reflexive'' reading is not triggered by the presence of a subject PRO or pro, but rather by the absence of reflexive marking, i.e. overt marking that functions to recode lexically specified co-reference relations between the arguments of a predicate. I argue that nominalizations and participles are structurally fairly rich, and that the relation between ``full'' verbs and nominalizations and participles is fairly transparent. I further argue that the verb-phrase needs to be decomposed into at least two subparts/subevents and that each sub-event carries information about the participants involved in it (as in e.g. Pustejovsky 1995 and Ramchand 2008).  I will further argue that there basically is no difference between using a reflexive pronoun to create a reflexive reading and using a reflexive pronoun to form an anti-causative reading -- it's all about re-coding the co-ference relations between the arguments of a predicate. The article also shows that phenomena like participle formation, nominalizations and argument ``reduction'' can all be handled in the syntax if we follow the so-called superset principle of lexical insertion. No generative lexicon is therefore needed. This article focuses on data from Swedish, but comparisons will be made with English.",1
"We address the issue of non-concatenative morphology from a minimalist perspective, trying to see how much of the attested phenomena can be dealt with by independently motivated assumptions about syntax and phonology, and how much can reasonably be dealt with by lexical listing. The residue, we argue, is quite restricted in character. We propose a specific model of spell-out and lexical entries which handles the cases we discuss, which include mutation, ablaut, templatic effects, metathesis, subtraction, and various other phenomena. We suggest that the ""Readjustment rules"" of DM can be done away with, and that morpheme-specific constraints are unnecessary. However, we do rely on positional attributes for specially marked morphemes. We argue that this device allows a unification of infixes and second-position clitics, while allowing syntax and phonology to be appropriately constrained.",0
"Ergative case, the special case of transitive subjects, raises questions not 

only for the theory of case but also for theories of subjecthood and transitivity. This paper analyzes the case system of Nez Perce, a three-way ergative language, with an eye towards a formalization of the category of transitive subject. I show that it is object agreement that is determinative of transitivity, and hence of ergative case, in Nez Perce. I further show that the transitivity condition on ergative case must be coupled with a criterion of subjecthood that makes reference to participation in subject agreement, not just to origin in a high argument-structural position. These two results suggest a formalization of the transitive subject as that argument uniquely accessing both high and low agreement information, the former through its (agreement-derived) connection with T and the latter through its origin in the speciﬁer of a head associated with object agreement (v). In view of these ﬁndings, I argue that ergative case morphology should be analyzed not as the expression of a syntactic primitive but as the morphological spell-out of subject agreement and object agreement on a nominal.",1
"We propose a derivational model that rejects the idea that reduplicated forms show multiple copies of phonological material, one of which has priority as a 'base', with the others as 'copies' or 'reduplicants'. In such a system, it is meaningless to ask if a totally reduplicated form like Warlpiri kurdukurdu involves prefixation or suffixation.  Our model treats reduplication as multiple projection of phonological material with no surface substring having priority as 'base'. Our projection rules can be ordered with other rules to derive a wide range of phenomena (such as so-called 'overapplication' and 'underapplication') that have mistakenly been used to argue for the logical necessity of non-derivational, constraint-based formalisms such as Optimality Theory.",1

"This paper contains a simple overview of Icelandic verbal categories and a theoretically more elaborated analysis of Icelandic mood (and tense). It argues that both speech time setting and mood selection in Icelandic is controlled by SPEAKERS TRUTHFULNESS RESPONSIBILITY. Clauses that are the Speakers Truthfulness Responsibility are typically indicative, with an independent speaker anchored speech time. Clauses that are not the Speakers Truthfulness Responsibility are most commonly subjunctive (or infinitive), with a conceived speech time that is not the speakers. It is thus evident that the SPEAKER feature is an active category in Narrow Syntax.",0
"As indicated early by Charles Darwin, languages behave and change very much like living species. They display high diversity, differentiate in space and time, emerge and disappear. A large body of literature has explored the role of information exchanges and communicative constraints in groups of agents under selective scenarios. These models have been very helpful in providing a rationale on how complex forms of communication emerge under evolutionary pressures. However, other patterns of large-scale organization can be described using mathematical methods ignoring communicative traits. These approaches consider shorter time scales and have been developed by exploiting both theoretical ecology and statistical physics methods. The models are reviewed here and include extinction, invasion, origination, spatialorganization, coexistence and diversity as key concepts and are very simple in their defining rules. Such simplicity is used in order to catch the most fundamental laws of organization and those universal ingredients responsible for qualitative traits. The similarities between observed and predicted patterns indicate that an ecological theory of language is emerging, supporting (on a quantitative basis) its ecological nature, although key differences are also present. Here, we critically review some recent advances and outline their implications and limitations as well as highlight problems for future research.",0
"This dissertation examines three topics in the morphosyntax of Lubukusu (Bantu, Kenya), all of which are concerned with agreement with subjects: locative inversion, complementizer agreement, and alternative agreement effects in subject extraction. Each topic reports novel Lubukusu data which are both typologically interesting and theoretically relevant within the frameworks of the Minimalist Program and Distributed Morphology. Specifically, each of these topics addresses the question of directionality in probe-goal relations, entertaining the hypothesis that heads may probe upwards in a structure (Baker 2008).



The first topic is the morphosyntax of subject extraction, in which it is argued that the Criterial Freezing framework of Rizzi and Shlonsky (2007) accounts for Lubukusu subject onsubject extraction asymmetries. It is then demonstrated that this approach to subject extraction explains the alternative agreement effects (commonly referred to as anti-agreement effects: AAEs) that appear in Lubukusu and other Bantu languages, capturing facts which are unaccounted for by previous analyses. In the course of this discussion a variety of new data regarding anti-agreement effects in Lubukusu are introduced.



Second, it is demonstrated that there are two distinct locative inversion constructions in Lubukusu (termed disjoint agreement and repeated agreement), which differ in their subject agreement properties and possess different structures. The results add breadth and depth to the reported typology of locative inversion in Bantu languages (Buell 2007, Marten 2006) and other

languages (e.g. Culicover and Levine 2001 for English). The discussion of these constructions also addresses at length the nature of locative morphology which appears on verbs in Lubukusu, proposing a locative licensing projection (Location Phrase) to account for these properties.



Finally, Lubukusu has a complementizer which agrees with the matrix subject in an embedding context (e.g. John knows agr-that the boys left). The empirical properties of this agreement relation are reported in depth, and it is proposed that there are two conditions on this construction: the complementizer may only agree with the the immediately superordinate subject, and that subject must be an appropriate logophoric antecedent. It is claimed that complementizer agreement is actually triggered locally by a null logophoric operator in the left periphery of the embedded clause, and that the reference of this operator is determined by an obligatory control relationship with the matrix subject. This phenomenon is critically relevant for many current issues within the Minimalist architecture, including theories of agreement,phases, logophoricity, and subjecthood.",0
"This short paper is an introductory paper of my dissertation, which pursues a unified raising analysis of Japanese passives, adapting Chris Collins'(2005) smuggling analysis of English passives. It is well-known that Japanese has two types of passives--Direct and Indirect Passives. The critical difference between the two types is the availability of the active source. This paper aims to unify the two types by analyzing indirect passives, which are alleged to be gapless, as having an active source. Specifically, the paper argues that indirect passives are also a type of direct passives containing a gap that corresponds to an oblique argument of the complement of -rare.",0
"The central claim of this dissertation is that aspect-based split ergativity does not mark a split in how Case is assigned, but rather, a split in sentence structure. Speciﬁcally, I argue that the contexts in which we ﬁnd the appearance of a nonergative pattern in an otherwise ergative languagenamely,  the nonperfective aspectsinvolve an intransitive aspectual matrix verb and a subordinated lexical verb. In other words, the nonperfective forms show a dissociation between the syntactic predicate and the stem carrying the lexical verb stem. This proposal builds on the proposal of Basque split ergativity in Laka 2006, and extends it to other languages. 



I begin with an analysis of split person marking patterns in Chol, a Mayan language of southern Mexico. I argue that the appearance of split ergativity in the language follows naturally from the fact that the progressive and the imperfective morphemes are verbs, while the perfective morpheme is not. Ergative-patterning perfective constructions are thus monoclausal, while progressives and imperfectives involve an aspectual matrix verb and a nominalized embedded clause. The fact that the nonperfective morphemes are verbs, combined with independent properties of Chol grammar, results in the appearance of a split. 



Next, after focusing on Chol, I survey aspect splits in a variety of unrelated languages and offer an explanation for the following universal: in a language with an aspectual split, the perfective aspect will always retain an ergative pattern (Dixon 1979). Following Lakas (2006)  proposal for Basque, I suggest that the cross-linguistic tendency for imperfective aspects to pattern with locative constructions is responsible for the biclausality which causes the appearance of a nonergative pattern. Building on Demirdache and Uribe-Etxebarrias (2000) prepositional account of spatiotemporal relations, I propose that the perfective is never periphrastic (and thus never involves a split) because there is no preposition in natural language that correctly captures the relation of the assertion time to the event time denoted by the perfective aspect; instead, perfective is the default aspect. The proposal here thus accounts both for the appearance of aspect-based split ergativity without the need for special rules of Case assignment, and also provides an explanation for why we ﬁnd the splits in certain aspects and not others.",0
"The aim of this paper is to present the behaviour of NN compounds in English and Romanian, and to offer an account for the productivity of NN compounds in English versus their lack of productivity in Romanian. It is a general observation that NN compounds are productive in Germanic languages, but unproductive in Romance languages. In this paper, we will try to look at this contrast by examining NN compounds in English and Romanian.
The paper is structured as follows. In Chapter 1, we present the various types of NN compounds existing in English and in Romanian, and we show that, while NN compounds are numerous in English, they are rather scarce in Romanian, where, instead of the NN pattern (sunflower, rattle snake), we find either the N+N in the Genitive pattern (floarea soarelui 'flower-the sun-GEN', i.e. 'sunflower') or the N+ de/ cu ('of/ with')+ N pattern (şarpe cu clopoţei 'snake with rattles', i.e. 'rattlesnake').
In Chapter 2, we discuss various syntactic representations that have been proposed for NN compounds in English. What these syntactic representations show very clearly is the fact that NN compounds are not linear strings of nouns, but they are hierarchically organized.
Chapter 3 deals with the acquisition of NN compounds in English and Romanian. In the case of English, we relied on longitudinal and experimental data as reported in previous studies, showing the productivity of NN compounds in child English. In the case of Romanian, we devised experiments in which we tested the comprehension of NN sequences by children and adults, and the production of NN compounds by children and adults. In the comprehension test, we asked the subjects to choose out of a range of four drawings that which they thought best fitted the NN sequence they heard (e. g. broască porc (lit. 'pig frog'), cȃine măgar (lit. 'dog donkey')). The drawings correspond to four possible interpretations of the NN sequence: both animals, a hybrid creature (half one animal, half another), the first animal with the attributes of the second, the second animal with the attributes of the first. Given the fact that there are few NN compounds in Romanian and that the other patterns take care of the endocentric interpretations, we would expect the hybrid creature interpretation to be the dominant one. Indeed, the prediction is confirmed by the results of the experiment. In the production experiment, we showed the subjects pictures made of halves (half an animal, half another), and we asked them to name the creature. While Romanian adults opted for NN compounds almost exclusively, very few children did so, unlike in English, where NN compounds are productive from early on. The experiments thus reveal that, although NN compounds do exist in child Romanian, they are not as productive as in child English.
Finally, in Chapter 4, we try to provide an account for the reason why NN compounds are productive in English, but not productive in Romanian. To this purpose, we have evaluated various accounts. On the Compounding Parameter account (Snyder 1995), the reason for the lack of productivity of NN compounds in Romanian is the fact that Romanian has a negative setting for the Compounding parameter, a parameter which is responsible both for the occurrence of NN compounds and of complex predicate constructions (such as resultatives). On the Rich vs. Poor Morphology Account (starting from Di Sciullo 2005), the reason for which Romanian has few NN compounds is related to the fact that it is a language with rich morphology, and so, its compounds are formed in the domain of syntax, escaping thus the NN pattern. On the Case Account, the reason is the fact that, in Romanian, there can be no caseless nouns. On the Noun Movement Account, the presence of the patterns N+N in the Genitive and N+ de/ cu ('of/ with')+ N can be explained by the fact that nouns always move out of the N0 position in Romanian, while this is not the case in English. We have tried to show that, while the Compounding Parameter account is problematic (it assumes, for example, that more or less the same mechanism is at stake both in the formation of compounds and in the formation of resultatives), and there are serious counterarguments against the Rich vs. Poor Morphology account (German, for instance, is a language with rich morphology, but, in spite of this, it does have NN compounds), the accounts which seem to be more able to cope with the issue of productivity versus lack of productivity of NN compounds are the Case Account and the Noun Movement account. Moreover, the two accounts can be related given the fact that case assignment usually involves noun movement.
The paper thus brings experimental evidence in favour of the fact that Romanian NN compounds are not productive and tries to come up with an account for why this is so.",0
"This paper investigates the morphosyntactic features of borrowed verbs attested in written French-based code-switching (CS) as used in online forums by bilingual Cameroonians residing in Europe and the USA. I focus on the structural rather than the functional aspect of online CS. I discuss the distributional features of inflected and non-inflected borrowed verbs in order to determine which structural pattern of CS is predominant in the corpus. My objective is to contribute to the empirical and descriptive study of CS among Cameroonian internet users. The assumptions adopted in this paper are based on Myers-Scotton's (2002, 2008) 4-M model of morphemes classification in CS data. I seek to uncover a number of constraints that account for when Embedded Language (EL) elements in bilingual speech may take Matrix Language (ML) inflection and when they may surface as bare forms. This question is especially relevant with regards to verbs. While Myers-Scotton does invoke the congruence hypothesis, her writings do not work this out sufficiently. In the case of Camfranglais (the term used to describe the data I am investigating), there is a further interest because CS ordinarily entails a ML-EL pair but here there is a ML (French) and multiple EL's, specifically English, Pidgin, Duala, and Ewondo. The findings of this study are consistent with 4-M model predictions (at least for finite verbs and present participles) in that all grammatical morphemes and word order are that of French, the dominant language that sets the morphosyntactic frame of the clause in Camfranglais. However, the congruence hypothesis does not explain why bare forms overwhelmingly occur in Camgfranglais data. Using quantitative data concerning the structural distribution of EL verbs in Camfranglais, I show that the model proposed here has more explanatory power than the 4-M model in regards to the existence of bare forms.",0
"Focusing on the Germanic and Romance languages, this paper discusses some differences between articles and demonstratives with regard to syntactic distribution and morphological transparency.

"In this paper I argue that a probe which searches for a value of feature X can exceptionally be valued by a feature Y if (i) X and Y form a natural class and if (ii) massive probe impoverishment, as suggested in Béjar (2003), applies. I call a probe that is valued by a different feature than the feature it originally probed for a ""chameleon probe"". As a consequence of massive impoverishment, the probe is underspecified for the exact feature it searches for and can thus be valued by any member of the natural class of features. I exemplify this phenomenon in the Uralic language Mordvin, where a number probe can be valued by a person feature if both arguments of a transitive verb are singular, leading to a third cycle of Agree in Béjar's (2003) system. The chameleon probe approach derives the unexpected distribution of person markers in a subpart
of the Mordvinian definite declension.",0
A well-known and uncontroversially universal property of natural languages is what Charles F. Hockett called duality or duality of patterning. This property can be expressed in the following terms: linguistic expressions can be decomposed into minimal meaningful discrete units commonly called morphemes that in turn can be decomposed into minimal distinctive though meaningless discrete units called phonemes. Here we study how certain conditions mainly related to mathematical information theory and structural complexity favor the emergence of the duality of patterning.,0
"Asymmetrical, disharmonic and skewed distributions are widespread in several domains of the

human language system as a whole. These patterns, which, if conceived as a logical space generated

by a 2-by-2 factorial design, often appear to fall into a skewed, asymmetrical configuration; frequently, a clear-cut 3-out-of-4 pattern can be established but, if not, a general imbalance is usually

still predominant. {\em Inter alia}, examples of such configurations are Holmberg's Generalisation, FOFC, the Square of Opposition ({\em id est} the nonlexicalisation of the O corner), Romance Interrogatives, Greenberg's Universal 25, Monotonicity and constraints on negation, Subject-Pro-Drop, N-drop, clause syntax and illocutionary force mismatching etc.\\



The central question to pose is whether such 3/4-patterns underlyingly are significant for the Faculty of Language or whether they simply are epiphenomena without further meaning or implications. In this article I argue that linguistic structures are sets of sets of purely privative atomic features which display surface phenomena such as asymmetries or skewings as a consequence of underlying feature interaction; I call this the Atomic Feature Conjecture. I suggest that features are combined by means of Merge and I demonstrate that there are three types of feature relationships: independence, dependence and antagonism. As far as asymmetry is concerned, I define two types of asymmetrical patterns: Type B, simultaneous incompatibility; and Type M, feature dependence. I furthermore outline consequences of these findings for Linguistic Theory, emphasising, on the one hand, the importance of privative features, and, on the other hand, the notion of the empty set as a fundamental component of the computational system. Ultimately, I also address remaining theoretical dilemmas stemming from the proposal and discuss future directions that cross-disciplinary research within the field could take.",0
"This is a study of phonological reanalysis--in particular, of the type of reanalysis, typified by rule inversion, in which an existing alternation is reanalyzed as due to an innovative rule whose reality is shown by subsequent extension of the alternation to forms that did not originally display it.  The main data set is constituted by the suffixal alternations of Japanese verb inflection, which have been analyzed in at least four distinct ways in the literature.  In dealing with the question of which analysis is the descriptively adequate one, I depend on the principle, due to Kiparsky, that synchronic structure constrains change, so that change can be diagnostic of structure:  in the context of a general model of the inferential relation between synchrony and diachrony in inflectional morphophonology, I compute the predictions for potential change for three analyses of the Japanese alternations and show that only one is consistent with the results of a nationwide survey of inflection.  With regard to the explanatory principles governing the choice of the descriptively adequate analysis, the overriding criterion is seen to be predictability of inflected forms (IF Predictability); I consider and reject, however, the position that speakers evaluate for IF Predictability a unitary complex of base forms and rule(s), concluding on the basis of attested or ongoing reanalyses in Portuguese and Korean that base forms are chosen first and that only then do speakers deal with the question of whether the alternation is rule-governed.  Finally, without taking a stand on the descriptive question of how much less constrained rules resulting from reanalysis are (how much ""crazier"" they can be) compared with rules (or constraints) that directly reflect the phonologization of phonetic variation, I suggest that the phonology of phonologization and the phonology of reanalysis are sharply distinct at the explanatory level--in particular, in their respective principles of base form choice.",1
"This paper presents morphosyntactic evidence against the movement theory of control espoused by Hornstein (1999) and defended in his subsquent work (Boeckx and Hornstein 2003, 2004, 2006). Standard Indonesian presents an important testing ground for this theory due to its syntatically governed distribution of the active voice morphology (Cole and Hermon 1998): the movement of an NP across a verb with the active voice prefix meN- results in the obligatory deletion of the prefix from the verb. In examples of obligatory control in this language, the prefix cannot be deleted but rather must be retained in the control verb. These examples thus provide important morphosyntactic evidence against the movement theory of control in Indonesian.",1
"Abstract:  In a syntacticocentric approach to morphology, we expect to see morpheme orders which mirror syntactic structure. Three mechanisms are commonly proposed to change the order of syntactic terminal elements at the morphology/syntax interface, including head-movement, morpheme-specific prefix/suffix specification and morphological merger. Given that each mechanism is independently well-motivated, we can ask what kind of patterns we might expect to see when they co-occur. I argue that two particularly flagrant cases of Mirror Principle violations, in Cupeño and Navajo, can be accomodated within the syntacticocenric framework using just these tools, without positing any additional special word-formation mechanisms, or any additional quasi-syntactic operations.",0

"This paper focuses on the question how to understand the quite frequent restrictions on recursion. I show such restrictions are to be accounted for at the syntax phonology interface, when syntactic structures are transferred to phonology under late spell out models. The main thesis of this paper is that phonological properties can be grafts on the structure building epp, and can have the effect of reigning in recursion. this cuts across syntax and morphology. The epp thus serves as a repository of the extremely finely grained knowledge speakers have of the phonological properties associated with local syntactic environments.",0
"This short paper argues for the relatedness of (i) the stem suppletion

in the German possessive determiner `ihr (her) relative to the `ein'-words `mein (my), `dein (your), and `sein (his), and (ii) the availability of two DP-internal possessor positions in Hungarian.



The three empirical links between German morphology and Hungarian syntax are

(i) the fact that `ihr' has all the hallmarks of an `ein'-word, other than overt `ein'; (ii) Possessor Doubling, which exposes a Hungarian-looking syntactic contrast between `ihr (her) and `sein (his); and (iii) Swiss German, whose possessive determiners exhibit the same syntactic contrast independently of `ein'-word formation.



The significance of the discussion is (A) that it uncovers a considerable amount of syntactic structure inside of possessive determiners, and, by doing so, (B) that it unmasks a stem suppletion as an epiphenomenal matter, a side effect of a basically syntactic contrast.",0
"In this paper, we discuss the nature of morphologically complex verbs known as zi-verbs in Japanese, such as zi-satu-suru kill oneself and zi-kai-suru collapse. Zi-verbs consist of three parts: the zi-morpheme, Sino-Japanese verbal nouns, and the light verb suru do. The descriptive investigation

of the syntax and semantics of this verbal class has been undertaken for the first time in Japanese linguistics by Tsujimura and Aikawa (1996, 1999), but the fuller examination of the true nature of zi-verbs within the wider context of the theory of argument structure is yet to be conducted. This paper develops a comprehensive theoretical account of object-less zi-verbs in terms of Lexical

Conceptual Structure and its mapping to Argument Structure (Levin and Rappaport-Hovav 1995, among others). Tsujimura and Aikawa treat object-less zi-verbs uniformly as reflexive verbs that have an unaccusative structure. Arguing against their analysis, we provide a variety of syntactic, morphological, and semantic arguments and show that object-less zi-verbs are further classified into three subtypes in terms of their argument structure as (a) transitive, (b) unaccusative and (c) unergative. We also claim that the zi-morpheme that arises in each type of verb has a different function/meaning: the morpheme used in the (a) type of verbs functions as an argument, while it functions as an adjunct in the (b) and (c) types.",0
"The view that the clause and the noun phrase are parallel in interesting ways has a strong tradition. This paper goes a step further, making an aspect of this idea more concrete by identifying a shared morpheme, German d-. But more importantly, and here lies the focus of the paper, it extends the parallelism to include the adjectival domain. The morpheme d- is argued to spell out a certain left peripheral head indiscriminately of the nature of the lexical category head of its containing extended projection, i.e. across V, N, and A.



The study discusses primarily two grammatical alternations in Germanic. The first is that between a low and a left peripheral (V2) position of the finite verb. The second is that between definite (weak) and indefinite (strong) adjectival agreement. I argue that the two alternations are instantiations of the same underlying dichotomy, and therefore must receive analogous analyses. Notably, given that verb placement is derived by syntactic movement, sensitive to the presence of a complementizer, the adjectival inflection alternation is also analyzed as derived by syntactic movement, and is also shown to be sensitive to the presence of a ``complementizer.''



The generalization that ensues from adjectival, verbal, nominal, comparative, and historical considerations, is that there is a left peripheral head, F, in Germanic which  either attracts a low category, containing the lexical category-head of the extended projection (the verb, the adjective, or the noun), or is realized as d-. This proposal is strongly supported by the typological generalization within Germanic that embedded V2 in the presence of an overt complementizer is readily available exactly in those languages whose complementizer is not a d-word.",0
"This paper proposes that case decomposes into a number of separate functional projections, ordered in a universal functional sequence. Cross-linguistic variation in position and complexity of case morphology is then accounted for in terms of differential noun phrase movement within the invariant sequence (Cinque 2005). I further investigate the possibility that variation in movement may be reduced to variation in the shape of the actual lexical entries. In order to implement this, the model of cyclic spell out by Starke (2009b) is adopted. In this model, each step of external merge is followed by lexical access. Consequently, evacuation movements may be triggered after each step of external merge in order for successful lexicalization to take place.",0
"Despite its potential appeal, the possibility of analyzing prefixes as prepositions (and thus as syntactic objects) faces several problems related with selection, headedness and semantic isomorphism. In this article, we try to understand and solve these problems. We focus on prefixed nouns, and more specifically on the fact that some of them have their bases interpreted as grounds (pre-coma, âsomething before a comaâ), while others have them interpreted as figures (pre-cognition, âcognition before somethingâ). We will propose that in the structures where the base can be interpreted as figure or ground the prefix is a very low prepositional modifier of the noun and the two readings depend on the interpretation of a pronominal category introduced by the preposition. This configuration is forced by the absence of a functional category from the prepositionâs structure; when independent conditions force this functional category to be present, the figure reading is impossible and the prefix behaves as a preposition.",0
"In the past fifteen years of minimalist investigation, the theory of argument structure and argument structure alternations has undergone some of the most radical changes of any sub- module of the overall theoretical framework, leading to an outpouring of new analyses of argument structure phenomena in an unprecedented range of languages. Most promisingly, several leading researchers considering often unrelated issues have converged on very similar solutions, lending considerable weight to the overall architecture. Details of implementation certainly vary, but the general framework has achieved almost uniform acceptance. In this paper, we recap some of the many and varied arguments for the 'split-vP' syntactic architecture which has taken over most of the functions of theta theory in the old Government and Binding framework, and consider how it can account for the central facts of argument structure and argument structure-changing operations. We then review the framework-wide implications of the new approach, which are considerable.",0
"The phenomenon of Differential Object Marking has been a topic of research in syntax (Aissen (2003), Næss (2004), Torrego (1998), Carnie (2005) among others) and morphology (Keine and Müller (2008)). The survey of the literature describing the DOM phenomenon (Bossong (1985), (1991), (1997), Baerman et al (2005) among others) reveals three major patterns of syncretism in DOM cross-linguistically. This paper offers a unified account of the three major patterns of syncretism in DOM. I argue for the existence of a single unified DOM rule. I propose that the choice of a case syncretism pattern in a DOM language is determined by (i) the presence/absence of Nom=Acc syncretism (Neutralization rule) (ii) the order of application between the DOM rule and the Neutralization rule. The advantage of this proposal is that the specific outcome of the DOM rule is partly predicted from the properties of a languages case system. The paper makes a theoretical contribution by providing an empirical and conceptual argument in favor of a feature freezing operation (Calabrese (1998)) in contrast to an impoverishment operation (Halle and Marantz (1994)).",0
"This paper addresses the compositionality puzzle presented by a class of little studied 'pseudo-resultative' predicates, such as 'tight' in the sentence 'She braided her hair tight'.  These predicates superficially resemble resultative secondary predicates, however it is shown that they do not modify any word in the syntax. Rather, these predicates modify the category-neutral root of the verb in a configuration which is licensed by the underlying structure of implicit creation verbs. The modification of such roots provides evidence that they are syntactically active, as proposed in the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993, Marantz 1997, Arad 2003).  It is shown that the roots are syntactically well-behaved and can be modified just like other 'larger' constituents.  Syntactic parallels between the implicit creation verbs which license pseudo-resultative predicates and other structures further provides evidence for a syntactic decomposition of these verbs whereby the object is related to the root in a prepositional structure in a manner reminiscent of proposals for other classes of verbs in Hale and Keyser (1993) and Hale and Keyser (2002).",1
"Four properties of short 'pre-head modifiers' in English demand attention. First, they violate the head-initial parameter setting for English phrases. Second, they cannot select complements nor undergo phrasal movement. Third, complements rather than heads receive the main stress in phrases (Nespor and Vogel 1982). But non-emphatic standard stresses in very expensive glasses, fondly described, proudly defiant and directly behind are all on the X0 heads. Fourth, most English ""A-ly adverbs"" in post-head or other positions alternate with non-parenthetical PP phrases such as in an A way or to an A degree. But many–ly adverbs do not alternate with such PPs. 
This paper argues that these 'pre-head modifiers' are in fact themselves heads which are grammatical heads (v, a, p, and n) whose complements are the traditionally termed VP, AP, PP and NP they have previously been thought to modify. The four (or five) problems above disappear. This solution leads to interesting consequences, which the paper briefly addresses,  i.e. –ly is then a late inserted inflectional head of these 'adverbs', which are in fact adjuncts of category A located in head positions.",0
"Indo-European morphological case systems exhibit considerably more syncretism between nominative and accusative cases than between other pairs of cases. This reflects the fact that the two case-assigning categories for nominative and accusative, namely the finiteness constituent I and the lexical verb, are facets of the same basic category, call it simply V. That is, I = V, +I and the verb = V, –I. Assuming further that case morphemes are simply ""Alternative Realizations"" of the case assigners, then a nominal projection with an alternatively realized V-feature that lacks further specification as either +I (nominative) or –I (accusative) has a neutralized case, called here ""Super Case"".
The paper analyses a range of morphological case regularities of Romanian, Latin,German and Czech and demonstrates show that an undifferentiated ""V-case"" playsa central role in these four quite different systems. Consequently, the four basic cases of Government and Binding research actually reduced to three, V-case (Super Case),N-case (genitives) and P-case (obliques, i.e. dative, ablative, instrumental, etc.).
Further, investigation shows that so-called neuter gender in Latin, German and
Czech is a name for a subset of masculine inanimate nouns which have a special relationto V-case but are otherwise regular. Lexical entries of neuter noun stems in Latinand German have an inherent V-case feature, which makes suffi xal case morphemes redundant on both Latin nouns and German singular determiners. The traditional classificatory terminology in Czech is reversed, in that its regular masculine inanimates are those traditionally terms neuters (aut- ""car"", masl- ""butter""). While its masculine inanimate nouns that carry an inherent V-case feature, making redundant (similar to Latin neuters) any special V-case suffixes, are those called ""masculine inanimates"" (hrad ""castle"", most ""bridge""). ""castle"", most ""bridge"").",0
"In this article we will provide evidence in favour of Phrasal Spell

Out (PSO), a procedure of lexical insertion where non-terminal

nodes in a tree configuration can be targeted by spell-out. We will

propose that the formal differences between two Spanish

indefinite pronouns, alguien and alguno, can be captured if the

morpheme -ien is analyzed as a lexical item which corresponds to

a syntactic phrase; this phrase, crucially, is broken in the presence

of a plural number projection. Independent properties of the

internal syntactic structure of the interrogative make the lexical

item -ien compatible with plural in that configuration.",0
"This paper proposes an analysis of the shift to the strict VO word order in the history of
English. We begin with pointing out that the previous accounts of this shift are problematic at
least for two reasons. First, they do not explain why at some point in its history English became
a strict word order language, nor why it became strict VO rather than strict OV. Second, they do
not capture a number of diachronic and cross‐linguistic facts. We provide a principled account
of the shift to the strict VO under which these facts fall into place. We argue that the setting of
strict VO in English was necessitated by the loss of morphological case on nominals. This
follows from a theory in which the presence of zero case exponents requires local licensing at
the PF interface.",0
"This paper presents a quantitative study of a change in the encoding of direction from the Old
French period to the Middle French period: the loss of verb-particle combinations. Using a large
electronic corpus, we test a previous hypothesis about the cause of this change from the theoretical
literature, namely, that the loss of directional particles was caused by another change in the language
around that period: the lexicalization of directional and aspectual prefixes onto verbal roots. We argue
that a link between the two changes is not verified by our data. Through this study, we also investigate
the extent to which argument structure change parallels another type of morpho-syntactic change:
abstract parameter change. We argue that the shape of change in the valency of predicates is different
from that of parameter change because argument structure change is sensitive to many more factors,
including the semantics of particular lexical expressions.",0

Writing is a productive skill. It is one of the most difficult and therefore frustrating subjects to teach particularly in an ESL/EFL programme. This paper is an outcome of teachers concerns and efforts to identify areas of difficulty in the writing skill among EFL students and to work out remedial procedures to help them overcome their weaknesses. The study examines 40 exam scripts of first year university students majoring in English. Two topics were given to the students whom were asked to write freely and to express their positive and negative points of view about certain topics. The students errors were grouped and analysed. The study concludes with pedagogical recommendations.,0
"This paper explores an understudied and poorly understood phenomenon of morphological syncretism in which a morpheme otherwise used to mark the head of a possessive NP appears on words naming property concept (PC) states (states named by adjectives in languages with that lexical category; Dixon 1982) in predicative and attributive contexts. This phenomenon is found across a variety of unrelated languages. We examine its manifestation in Ulwa, an endangered Misumalpan language of Nicaragua, where diachronic evidence clearly shows that a single affix is involved. We propose an explanation for the syncretism based on an explicit syntactic and semantic analysis of the relevant constructions. On the proposed explanation, the syncretism arises out of a combination of semantic and morphosyntactic facts of Ulwa grammar. Specifically, we propose that the Ulwa pattern exemplifies a possessive strategy of predication. Intuitively, this strategy is a manifestation in grammar of the idiomatic equivalence between the property of being F and the property of having F-ness.",0
"In this paper, I propose a new structural domain for the non-compositional interpretation of roots based on the investigation of the semantics of verbal nouns and deverbal nominalizations in Japanese. Specifically, drawing on recent proposals on the licensing of external arguments and the non-compositional domain made by Pylkkänen (2002) and Harley (2007, 2008), I argue that the Voice head closes off the relevant domain. This analysis not only overcomes the conceptual problem with Volpes (2005) treatment of the causative affix in Japanese as a non-phase-defining affixal particle in the sense of den Dikken (1995) but also maintains the insight behind Arads (2003, 2005) locality constraint on the interpretation of roots with a modification that is independently motivated.",0

"This paper presents an alternative account of DP distribution that is based on DPs being selected rather than being Case-theoretically licensed. We argue that the fundamental prediction made by Case theory, namely that obligatorily controlled PRO and overt DPs are in complementary distribution, is not empirically justified. To this end, we provide data from nonfinite clausal adjuncts, complements and nominalizations in Tamil where subject controlled PRO and overt subject DPs seem to alternate in free variation. We further show that this type of problematic alternation is not a language-specific quirk but a widely attested crosslinguistic phenomenon with supporting evidence from Malayalam, Sinhala, Latin, Irish, Middle English as well as the Present-Day English gerundival construction. While standard Case theories are equipped to handle either the occurrence of PRO or that of an overt subject, they are unable to consistently handle the alternation between both types of elements described here.",0
"A spontaneous response to the panel on best statistical practices in sociolinguistics hosted by Sali Tagliamonte at the University of Ottawa. It is argued that VARBRUL's inability to handle continuous data is not a virtue, that the role of word and subject random effects has been misconstrued, that other techniques are not more difficult to use, interpret, or teach than VARBRUL, and that treating VARBRUL as the center of a community of practice is no better than a prescriptive or normative view of sociolinguistics as it is practiced.",0
The paper argues for a new approach to vocabulary insertion which allows insertion at non terminal nodes. This new Vocabulary Insertion Principle dispenses with the operation of Fusion in Distributed Morphology and allows more accurate predictions about possible portmanteau morphemes to be made. I test this new principle against data from local case morphology. I also propose a novel structure for local case affixes which is supported by evidence from implicational universals and attested/unattested portmanteau morphemes.,0
"Under a non-lexicalist view of word formation, such as Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993), morphemes combine to form complex words during or after but not before narrow syntactic derivation. Such a model inevitably requires the availability of downward transformations, e.g. affix-hopping. This thesis provides a detailed investigation into such downward movements. Whereas previous analyses have relegated downward movements to a position outside of core derivational processes (e.g. Chomsky 1981 and, to a lesser extent, Embick and Noyer 2001), I argue that certain downward movements, namely head-to-head Lowering, form part of the central architecture of syntactic derivation and are motivated by fundamental properties of that architecture, such as phase impenetrability (Chomsky 2001). 



Though this thesis addresses certain properties of other types of apparent downward movement (e.g. morpho-phonological merger; i.e. Local Dislocation), it focuses primarily on the defining characteristics of head-to-head Lowering. Central to this investigation is the observation that Lowering is a highly syntactic operation. In Chapter 2, I argue that a Lowering head may freely target any intermediate syntactic position of the complex head of its complement, thus deriving several cases of morphological optionality; e.g. reduplicative variability in Tagalog and Ndebele and the variable positions of agreement markers in Turkish.



Chapter 3 addresses tense-hopping, a canonical case of downward movement. I argue that certain asymmetries between English and Swedish provide evidence that these two languages derive their respective tense-hopping patterns via different means. Namely, Swedish tense-hopping is a case of Lowering, whereas English tense-hopping results from Local Dislocation (following Ochi 1999). Additionally, I propose a detailed theory of the Lowering vs. Raising distinction. Based in the observation that Lowering only ever takes place across a phase boundary, I posit a Phase Head Impenetrability Condition (PHIC), under which features embedded in a complex phase head become inaccessible as a result of Spell-out. Lowering occurs as a last resort feature-checking operation when the next highest head targets one of these embedded features; Raising occurs otherwise. I address several repercussions of this analysis, and in Chapter 4 I show that the PHIC allows for a straightforward account of the aux-raising vs. tense-hopping asymmetry in English. More precisely, I claim that auxiliary verbs are merged in the same phase as finite tense, and so the PHIC does not apply between these two elements, unlike with main verbs.



The analyses presented in this thesis all share a common goal  to show that downward movements can and should be incorporated into core linguistic theory.",0
"A wide range of literature has dealt with the verb system of Hebrew over the years, yet, most of these are either diachronic descriptions or textbooks which present a more traditional view. The descriptions of Hebrew in the literature comprise of all Hebrew layers. Those which claim to deal with Modern Hebrew suggest that the Hebrew verb system is a tense-based system, which consists of seven verb patterns. 

The current study was performed on a mini-corpus of Spoken Israeli Hebrew, which consisted of recorded spontaneous conversations of fifteen Israeli Hebrew speakers in different occasions. The results show some outstanding findings regarding the means, which Israeli speakers use to express tense, mood and aspect (TMA) in Hebrew, and suggest that Modern Hebrew is an aspect-based system rather than a tense-based one, which consists of only five verb patterns.",0

"This paper proposes a new analysis of the distribution of the active voice morphology in Standard Indonesian and Kendal Javanese. Specifically, an NP undergoes movement into the edge of vP to check and delete the D-feature of v. This deletion, in turn, blocks the active voice prefix from being inserted under v; its null counterpart is inserted instead as the elsewhere vocabulary item. I compare this analysis with two recent analyses presented by Cole et al. (2008) and Aldridge (2008). I point out empirical and typological problems with these analyses that are naturally resolved under our analysis. The proposed analysis lends support for the role of vP phases (Chomsky 2004) at the syntax-morphology interface and yields a new understanding of deletion as the failure of vocabulary insertion (Harley 2005).",0
"We study the statistical distributions of natural language and develop a novel approach to assess the properties of the underlying grammar given a sample of linguistic production.

"This dissertation has two inter-related goals: (i) to describe and provide novel analyses of three types of important phenomena within Amharic DPs and (ii) to explore the properties of the syntax-morphology interface. The core phenomena explicated are the unusual distribution of the definite marker, the gender system (which relies heavily on natural/biological gender), and the plural system (which involves the relations between several distinct types of plurals). The dissertation shows how these phenomena have important ramifications for morphosyntactic cyclicity, the morphosyntactic treatment of phi-features, and the relationship between the syntax and morphology of agreement. I show that the definite marker is best accounted for in two sub-cases. When obligatory, it is a second position clitic, and when optional, it is the reflex of a definiteness agreement process. The operation that places the definite marker in second position is shown to be unable to access previous syntactic cycles, i.e., there is phase impenetrability at PF. The accounts of both gender and number explore the division of labor between little n (the nominalizing head) and the root. I argue that both natural gender and grammatical gender must be present in the syntax, and propose that grammatical gender is a feature on roots, whereas natural gender is a feature on little n. In the number domain, the differences between regular and irregular plurals (and the behavior of double plurals in Amharic) are best analyzed with two different slots for plural features: they can appear on Number, for regular plurals, and on little n, for irregular plurals. The system of gendered plurals is derived from the interaction of the gender and number features on little n. Finally, I explore the syntax and morphology of feature sharing, arguing that the plural feature is in fact shared between Number and little n, and developing an account of the morphological realization of shared features. This account correctly predicts that all the types of plurals in Amharic are synonymous yet morphologically distinct. I further generalize the feature sharing analysis of plurals to account for all cases of DP-internal agreement.",1
"Generative theories of the syntax of null subjects distinguish between (i) some form of the EPP, (ii) licensing conditions on null subjects, such as Case licensing, and (iii) identification of null subjects in the sense of recoverability of f -features, regardless of whether the null subject is

referential pro, PRO, or a bound variable. Typically, the EPP is irrelevant for the reasoning because it is assumed that it is satisfied by a null subject (pro). The goal of this paper is to shift the perspective and bring the EPP into the picture. I argue that pro is not in Spec,TP. Consequently, for a null-subject structure to be grammatical, the extension requirement must be satisfied by something. Grammatical licensing and identification are thus viewed as necessary but not sufficient conditions for a null subject to be grammatical.",0
"Although there is broad agreement that many ERP components reflect error signals generated during an unexpected linguistic event, there are least two distinct aspects of the process that the ERP signals may reflect. The first is the content of an error, which is the  local discrepancy between an observed form and any expectations about upcoming forms, without any reference to why those expectations were held. The second aspect is the cause of an error, which is a context-aware analysis of why the error arose. The current  study examines the processes involved in prediction of past tense marking on verbal morphology in Hindi. This is a case where an error with the same local characteristics can arise from very different cues, one syntactic in origin (ergative case marking), and the  other semantic in origin (a past tense adverbial). Results suggest that the parser does indeed track the cause in addition to the content of errors. Despite the fact that the critical manipulation of verb tense marking was identical across cue types, the nature of the cue  led to distinct patterns of ERPs in response to anomalous verbal morphology. When verb tense was predicted based upon semantic cues, an incorrect future tense form elicited an early negativity in the 200-400 ms interval with a posterior distribution. In contrast, when  verb tense was predicted based upon morphosyntactic cues, an incorrect future tense form elicited a right-lateralized anterior negativity (RAN) during the 300-500 ms interval, as well as a P600 response with a broad distribution.",0
"This squib uses some facts about the Lunigiana varieties of Italian as described by Manzini & Savoia (2005) to build an argument in favor of the view that a single vocabulary item may lexicalize a non-trivial subtree.

"The morphological expression of gender on nouns displays a puzzling behaviour under ellipsis of nominal predicates. In some instances, it appears that gender can be ignored in the calculation of the identity/parallelism requirement. With other nouns, gender seems relevant and mismatch engenders parallelism violations. With yet a third group of nouns, there is an asymmetry - an overt masculine noun licenses ellipsis of the corresponding feminine, but not vice versa. The difference between the last two groups is exemplified by the English contrast in: John is a {waiter/#prince} and Mary is too (compare #Mary is a waitress/princess, and John is too). We examine six languages, and show that nouns for nobility/titles and kinship nouns form a systematic exception to an otherwise stable marked:unmarked opposition, and that when this class of nouns is factored out, the remaining two classes reflect the inflection/derivation distinction in the morphological realization of gender.",0
"The relationship of syntax to its adjacent components of realization and interpretation is examined from various phenomena referring to phi-features: agreement, syncretisms, gaps, synthetic-analytic alternations. A strongly modular architecture is indicated: (i) syntax is fully autonomous of morphophonology (realization); (ii) syntax and morphophonology differ partly in computational principles and information accessed; (iii) syntactic phi-specifications are partly independent of interpretation and sometimes uninterpretable. Superficially similar phenomena are distributed thereby between morphophonology and syntax, including clitic/affix syncretisms and alternations with pronouns. Among specific conclusions are: Syntax underlies some uninterpretable phi, including person hierarchy phenomena. Morphophonology is limited to the domain of the extended word / prosodic phrase, accesses a subset of syntactic properties beside purely morphophonological ones, and operates over less restricted feature combinations than syntax. Interpretation underdetermines some syntactically active phi-specifications and cannot see others (diachronic fossils, facultative features, fake indexicals).",0
"This paper proposes to analyze the German diminutive morpheme (""-chen"") as a classifier, based on its individuating function in connection with mass nouns. It is argued that this view paves the way for a unified analysis of numeral-classifier constructions in German: Phrasal forms and morphological forms (diminutives) are derived from the same underlying structure, the only difference being that in the latter case a syntactic transformation applies obligatorily in order to provide a phonological host for the clitic-like diminutive classifier.",0
"This article is intended as a contribution toward an emerging program (Adger & Smith 2005, Adger 2006, 2007) that seeks to account for intra-individual (or, Labovian sociolinguistic) variation (e.g., Chambers, Trudgill & Schilling-Estes 2002) within a broadly Minimalist theoretical framework  (Chomsky 1995 et seq., and related work). Following a specific approach (Parrott 2007, Nevins & Parrott In press, Parrott To appear), I attempt to implement this objective by utilizing the theory of Distributed Morphology (DM, Halle & Marantz 1993, Embick & Noyer 2007). Expletive constructions and their verbal agreement properties are a potentially productive point of contact between variationist sociolinguistics and morphosyntactic theory. Expletives and agreement, both in English and cross-linguistically, have long been important and central topics for generative syntax. Moreover, sociolinguists using variationist methods have documented abundant inter- and intra-individual variation in the forms of expletives and their corresponding agreement patterns for diverse varieties of English. This growing body of empirical data is evidently relevant for evaluating morphosyntactic-theoretical analyses of expletive constructions, as well as for developing a Minimalist theory of variation and change. With these larger issues in the background, the article takes a more narrow focus, concentrating on intra-individually variable there-expletive it (TEIT) (Parrott 2002) in a moribund English variety spoken on Smith Island, Maryland, U.S.A. (e.g., Schilling-Estes & Wolfram 1999).  After showing that TEIT with categorical 3rd singular (3sg) associate agreement is problematic for two particular Minimalist approaches (Cardinaletti 1997, Chomsky 2000), I follow a somewhat radical DM approach that denies the existence of uninterpretable Case or Agreement (or, phi = φ) features in the narrow syntax (McFadden 2004, Bobaljik 2008). I suggest that mechanisms of intra- and inter-individual variation are located in the semantically interpretable features of the expletive morphemes themselves and their interaction with language-specific, and sometimes variable, morphological φ-feature copying rules. These post-syntactic agreement operations are responsible for categorical 3sg agreement with TEIT, as well as for (variable) rightward associate agreement with expletive there. Thus, the proposed DM analysis captures not only the facts of TEIT on Smith Island, but accounts for a range of variation patterns attested in varieties of English.",1
"In the past fifteen years, lexical decomposition has become an accepted fact among syntacticians and semanticists working in the Chomskyan framework, particularly among those studying verbal argument structure, and particularly with respect to change- of-state verbs. Many of the analyses of verbal syntax and semantics that are now accepted essentially without comment are essentially modernized versions of the previously-discredited proposals of the Generative Semanticists. Progress is not retrograde, however: many of the most cogent empirical objections to the decompositional project have been answered, and there are at least some inklings of the explanations for others. The net result is that modern theories can capture many of the morphological, syntactic and semantic generalizations that motivated the original proposals in the first place, which were difficult to capture in the Lexicalist frameworks that dominated the field from the 1970s to the 1990s. The proposals also have serious scientific legs, in that they have made predictions and captured cross-linguistic generalizations that would have been impossible to contemplate without them. In this paper, I first take some time to
systematically address the status of some of the original empirical objections to the decompositional project, given a particular set of assumptions about how decomposition works in a modern framework. I then quickly survey some decompositional proposals with an eye to conveying the breadth and depth that the approach has developed. I focus primarily on English data, since that has been at the center of the debate for philosophers of language, but I will touch on some of the key points from unrelated languages which have particular relevance to the claims, from a linguists' point of view.",0
"(Written in Spanish) This approach to the notion of word is anti-lexicalist but does not share the typical conclusion that words are epiphenomena. Quite the contrary, this contribution places the word as a central and distinctive feature of human language. The apparent paradox that this entails is solved with the central hypothesis I intend to develop: that words are not lexical units, but are syntactic structures, and that these syntactic structures are the minimal units of connection between the conceptual-intentional and the sensory-motor systems. Thus, I argue that what makes the syntactic constructions we call words 'special' (ie lexical) is that they are the smallest units of human language in which there is a direct connection between meaning and sound. It follows then that traditional morphemes (including lexical roots) lack, to use Saussure's terms, of 'plane of expression', so that only 'words' would be linked with articulatory-perceptual systems. Since words are conceived of as syntactic constructions, then it follows that syntax is the authentic and unique interface between meaning and sound in (adult) human language.",1

"This paper argues for a fine-grained syntactic decomposition of Bantu noun class markers.



The Nguni languages (Xhosa, Zulu, Ndebele, Swati) exhibit systematic correspondences between the shape of an agreement marker (subject concords, object concords, adjectival concords) and a subpart of the full nominal class prefix of the corresponding noun class. For example, the class 2 adjectival concord is 'ba' and the full class 2 nominal prefix is 'a-ba', and the class 4 adjectival concord is 'mi' and the full class 4 nominal prefix is 'i-mi'. In general, the adjectival concords correspond to the part of the full nominal prefix following the initial vowel. However, subject concords and object concords seem to pick up on different parts of the nominal prefix in different noun classes, e.g. the class 2 subject concord is again 'ba', like the adjectival concord, while the class 4 subject concord is 'i'.
In this paper, I show that we can make sense of this only by assuming that a single morpheme can lexicalize a ""stretch"" of terminals rather than just a single terminal. Once we realize this, however, we can algorithmically use the distribution of morphemes over noun class prefixes, concords and demonstratives/determiners to determine the exact morphosyntactic structures underlying the various forms.",0

"In this paper I argue that both parametric variation and the alleged differences between languages in terms of their internal complexity straightforwardly follow from the Strongest Minimalist Thesis that takes the Faculty of Language (FL) to be an optimal solution to conditions that neighboring mental modules impose on it. In this paper I argue that hard conditions like legibility at the linguistic interfaces invoke simplicity metrices that, given that they stem from different mental modules, are not harmonious. I argue that widely attested expression strategies, such as agreement or movement, are a direct result of conflicting simplicity metrices, and that UG, perceived as a toolbox that shapes natural language, can be taken to consist of a limited number of markings strategies, all resulting from conflicting simplicity metrices. As such, the contents of UG follow from simplicity requirements, and therefore no longer necessitate linguistic principles, valued or unvalued, to be innately present. Finally, I show that the SMT does not require that languages themselves have to be optimal in connecting sound to meaning.",0

"In this paper I discuss hidden lexical entries: forms that are assumed to be represented in the mental lexicon even though they do not exist in the actual vocabulary, in order to account for derivational gaps. This mechanism is often criticized to be an ad-hoc, unfalsifiable theoretical tool and to lack psychological reality. I argue that in view of the commonly assumed interface between the mental lexicon and the conceptual system, hidden lexical entries are not unfalsifiable. To demonstrate this argument, I present an experiment designed to detect the hidden existence of gaps in the transitive-unaccusative alternation.",0

"This paper is a study in lexical categories; specifically, in nominality. Nouns are argued to refer primarily to kind-level sorts, which define categories of entities in the speakers' conceptualization. This notion is characterized in semantic, ontological, and cognitive terms. Sorts, or nominal concepts, represent what is specifically nominal in lexical semantics. Not all nominalized properties are concepts; in particular, not transparent deverbal nominalizations. Concepts thus provide a substantive notion of nominality not coextensive with the morphosyntactic one. I present some evidence for the linguistic reality of this notion. In word formation and in phrases like plastic flower, the semantic value of a noun is its concept and not what it may be true of. The two often differ, as concepts are typically based on function and conventional expectations more than on objective properties. Concepts also seem to be needed in expressing semantic restrictions on affixation (ornamental, but *employmental). Finally, concepts are the value of nouns, not of any of their pieces; in particular, not of roots. This emerges clearly from the examination of different nouns (and verbs) sharing one root, and accords with the view that lexical categories have content, and roots are category-free.",1
"This introduction presents the research project of the volume Verb-first, Verb-second and sketches its empirical domain and theoretical background, introducing the contributions to the volume through a survey of the main issues at stake. I present a typology of V2 languages, and discuss their parallels and divergences with V1 languages in a comparative and theoretical perspective. The definitional contrast between V1 and V2 is set up by an inventory of what can come first in V2 orders, from multiple XPs to heads, and V2 is discussed in the broader context of other second position phenomena. The syntactic properties associated in the literature with V2 are systematically confronted with crosslinguistic variation: verbfinality, particular underlying word orders, verb landing site, agreement morphology, VS adjacency, left periphery specific to V2, information structure constraints, and expletives. The reader is provided with robust typological generalisations and a clear terminology for a better understanding of the contributions in this volume and their context.",0
"This squiblet points out an interpretational asymmetry between ""cognate object"" and ""cognate subject"" constructions.

The snitch snitched). I suggest that this asymmetry is a novel argument in support of Hale and Keyser's syntactic incorporation account of English denominal verbs.",0

"In this paper I show that on closer inspection, implementing the cartographic approach to clausal architecture as a minimalist analysis proves to be problematic. I propose an alternative analysis of the C-domain as a single CP with multiple specifiers; ordered merge operations result from hierarchy-driven satisfaction of a feature hierarchy in C. Some seeming counterevidence comes from languages in which left-peripheral heads seem to be overtly marked. I present arguments in favour of the view that these markers are not syntactic heads, but affixes on the displaced constituent. Furthermore, I argue that sentence-initial complementisers followed by C-material are best analysed as a morpho-phonological phenomenon at the CP edge. They are dealt with within the framework of Distributed Morphology. Cross-linguistic variation in the phonological realisation of C-markers is accounted for by means of optimisation.",0
"Two strategies of NP-ellipsis have been identified in the literature: (a) the elision strategy, and (b) the pronominalization strategy. The former has been said to be dependent on the presence of inflectional morphology (i.e., agreement) on the adjectival remnant. The latter strategy is used when the adjectival remnant does not carry any inflectional morphology. 



The aim of this article is to show that there are languages, among which Dutch, where morphological agreement appears to be the licensing factor, but where one-insertion (i.e., the pronominalization strategy) is the actual strategy. We arrive at this conclusion via an in-depth and systematic micro-comparative investigation of NPE in a number of closely related languages and dialects, more specifically: Afrikaans, Frisian, (standard) Dutch and dialectal variants of Dutch. English will be included in our analysis as well, since it is a core example of the pronominalization (i.e., one insertion) strategy. One of the outcomes will be that languages/dialects may have available more than one NPE strategy.",1

While transitive verbs as in (1) show a NOM/ACC case pattern with the external argument marked nominative and the internal argument marked accusative (cf. 1), it can be shown that with reflexively marked anticausatives as in (2) the nominative theme is base-generated in a position c-commanded by the accusative reflexive pronoun, i.e. they involve an ACC/NOM case pattern. 

An analysis of reflexive anticausatives along the lines in (2) is by far not new. Here, however, I add on the one hand an empirical argument from German that this analysis is actually correct and, in addition, I investigate the consequences of the existence of the ergative split in (1) vs. (2) for the theory of structural case.

"In this paper we analyze the behaviour of causative forms from the Shapsug dialect of Adyghe (a.k.a. West Circassian, West Caucasian family) and show how it may be accounted for in the framework of First Phase Syntax (Ramchand 2003, 2008). The data concerning the aspectual behaviour of morphological causatives formed from different verb classes and the interpretation of these forms in the scope of negation and temporal adverbials suggest that the causative morpheme projects an aspectual projection (vP) in some important respects different from the vP encoded in the lexical meaning of the verb. The head v introduced by causative morphology seems to be in a way defective as compared to the ordinary v, in that only the former is transparent for scope-taking operators such as negation and temporal adverbials, and does not project its own aspectual structure. The data we discuss suggest that a theory of event structure should be sensitive to the distinction between lexical vs. morphological encoding of aspectual heads.",0
"This paper pursues the idea that uninterpretable features are not present in syntax, but are instead a product of the interfaces. In particular, it argues that formal feature values belong to PF only, i.e., that they are not syntactic objects but PF translations of more abstract syntactic structures and correlations. It follows that case is nonexistent in syntax and it also follows that agreement is a PF copying process, differing radically from abstract, syntactic Agree. Accordingly, most of the work of traditional syntax happens in PF and is thus invisible to the semantic interface, SF, that is, the computation proceeds on the PF side after transfer (a reversed Y-model, as it were).",0
"The dissertation discusses two types of participles (present and past (passive)) and two types of nominalizations ((n)ing-nominalizations and e/a-nde-nominalizations) in Swedish. The dissertation has two major goals: (I) to reach a better understanding of the 'lexical' semantics of different types of verbs by investigating which properties of the verbs survive in different types of nominalizations and participles, and (II) to pin down the exact semantic and morpho-syntactic properties of different types of nominalizing and participle forming morphemes in Swedish. My main claim is that the participial and nominalizing morphology in Swedish is semantically highly under-specified. The difference in interpretation that arises between the two participles on the one hand and the two nominalizations on the other has its base in height of attachment of the morphemes in question. However, in addition, to get the full distributional pattern and the interpretational possibilities of the participles and nominalizations one has to take into consideration the lexical specification of the verb and other ""blocking"" forms (irregular and zero-derived forms). The pattern that arises supports the more general idea that verbal semantics can be broken down into small semantic primitives in the syntax. Each of the derived forms can further give rise to a lot of interpretations (i.e., result and event interpretations for both participles and nominalizations). I argue that the different readings all derive from a single verbal entry, with the ambiguity arising from different subsets of syntactic and semantic features surfacing in the various readings.",0
"The goal of this thesis is twofold: The ﬁrst aim is to diagnose for phase heads on the basis of semantic, morphological and syntactic reﬂexes of movement, and to propose a phase model resting upon these empirical observations. This work examines most known reflexes of successive-cyclic movement and develops a phase model resting upon the empirical evidence. The result is that all core heads on the spine of the derivation -- C, I, v and V -- are phase heads. The main outcome is thus that each phrase is a phase. Phases are therefore not defined on semantic grounds, but by purely syntactic criteria: A phase comprises the smallest possible operation space that permits a successfuld derivation.





The second aim is to propose a uniform analysis for morphological and syntactic reﬂexes of successive-cyclic movement. The basic idea of the analysis is that morphological and syntactic path effects are due to the deletion of morpho-syntactic features of probing heads as a consequence of movement to the edge. Impoverishment thus happens in the syntax. Probe impoverishment has an effect on the inflectional markers that are post-syntactically inserted into the probe: If morphosyntactic features are deleted before vocabulary insertion takes place, then a marker M may not fit anymore into the relevant context. In this case a less specific marker than M is inserted. I formulate this generalisation as follows: When a language shows different exponents in movement and non-movement contexts, then the marker appearing in the context of movement is less specific than the marker appearing in non-movement contexts (=retreat to the general case, emergence of the unmarked).





I apply the new analysis not only on morphological, but also on syntactic path effects such as verb inversion. The decisive advantage of the new approach is that it offers a uniform analysis for all morphological and syntactic path effects which is yielded by a minimal change in the modelling of movement to the edge. The analysis correctly derives the surprising characteristic of long movement in languages like Chamorro that higher verbs do not register the argument status of the passing wh-element, but the respective argument status of the clause from which the wh-element is extracted. In addition, the analysis derives the effects of (seeming) extraction restrictions correctly without actually invoking these restrictions. Furthermore, syncretisms in the verbal morphology of Chamorro and Irish can now be treated as occurrences of one and the same underspecified marker. Finally, the new analyis delivers a new argument in favour of finite control as movement, and resolves two puzzles in the syntax in Kikuyu (subject-object extraction asymmetry, location of wh-subject below complementiser) by deriving that wh-subjects in this language can stay in situ while at the same time extraction morphology shows up.",1
"This thesis offers evidence that phases (Chomsky 1995) induce word-internal cycles of morphological and phonological interpretation. Phases proposed in the syntactic literature are shown to have effects word-internally, therefore supporting a representational theory of morpho-phonology (e.g. Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1994)).  It is argued that phases exist at the nP, aP, vP, vP, DP, and CP syntactic levels. These phases are shown to have differing behaviour with regards to the domain which is sent to PF upon merger of the phase head. DP, CP, and vP are argued to be complement spellout phases following Nissenbaum (2000). nP, aP, and vP, however, offer evidence that the head of a phase is interpreted at PF with its complement.  A possible motivation for this difference in interpretation domain is discussed.  It is in derivations where syntactic material spans one (or more) of these boundaries that cyclic domains may be found within words at PF. Phonological and morpho-syntactic patterns induced by word-internal phases are investigated.

Main stress patterns in Cupeño, Turkish, and Ojibwa are analysed.  Turkish and Cupeño seemingly irregular main stress patterns are argued to be regular at the phase level.  Main stress is assigned in these languages at the interpretation of the first phase.  In other words, main stress is cyclic and immovable in these languages. Ojibwa main stress assignment is then shown to be insensitive to word-internal phase boundaries.  Word internal phases are present in Ojibwa, as demonstrated by hiatus resolution strategies and footing patterns in the language (Piggott & Newell 2007).  Main stress is assigned to the word, regardless of its internal cyclic domains  it is post-syntactic.  These two patterns are argued to be the only possibilities for main stress assignment.

Some morpho-syntactic paradoxes are then investigated.  It is argued that word internal phases, in combination with late adjunction (Lebeaux 1988), are responsible for bracketing paradoxes, the dichotomous (phrase/word) nature of particle verbs, and semantically vacuous double affixation.  Languages discussed in this section are English, German, Breton, and Yiddish.  It is concluded that structural paradoxes arise only when an adjunct is late adjoined into a previously interpreted morpho-syntactic structure.

None of the data presented here arise solely in the phonological, morphological, or syntactic component of language. The effects of syntactic phases on morpho-phonology argue for the necessity of an integrated approach to linguistic investigation.",1
"In this paper, I propose a novel way to distinguish between agreement and clitic-doubling. The innovation lies in examining what happens when the relation in question fails to obtain.



Given a scenario where the relation R between an agreement-morpheme M and target noun-phrase X is broken - but the result is still a grammatical utterance - the proposed diagnostic supplies a conclusion about R as follows: if M shows up with default phi-features (rather than the features of X), then R is agreement; if, on the other hand, M disappears entirely, then R is clitic-doubling.



The workings of the proposed diagnostic are demonstrated using a family of constructions in dialectal Basque (Etxepare 2005). Besides supporting the proposed diagnostic, the analysis of Basque also provides an ancillary result, which would otherwise be unavailable, regarding the typological status of the Basque agreement system.",0
"This is the first chapter of a book manuscript. The book develops two

major themes. First, I present a cyclic (phase-based) theory of

syntax/morphology, and show how this theory provides an account of

attested patterns of allomorphy in language. Second, I compare the

predictions of this ""Localist"" type of theory with those of

""Globalist"" theories. Based on a number of case studies that center on

Phonologically Conditioned Allomorphy, I argue that the Localist view

is correct, and that this finding has important implications for

grammatical theory.

"Following the minimalist vantage point, current syntactic phase theory is based on extra-linguistic motivation: the reduction of computational complexity is aimed at reducing the burden of active memory, a costly cognitive resource. The instrument of this programme is interactionism (i.e. the interleaving of concatenation and interpretation) on the one hand, Phase Impenetrability (the PIC) on the other. The article shows that both have been invented in phonology, the former by Lexical Phonology in the early 80s, the latter by J. Kaye in the early 90s.

The interactionist character of Chomskyan phase theory affords a major break in generative interface theory. One consequence is that intermodular argumentation is now possible: the chunks that are designated by the spell-out mechanism for computation at PF must be the same on both sides. Also, the phonological and syntactic computation of these identical portions of the string must be restricted by the PIC in the same way. A particular syntactic analysis thus makes precise predictions on the phonological side, and vice-versa.

On these grounds, competing phonological analyses of affix class-based phenomena are compared. Since Lexical Phonology, the most popular solution are morpheme-specific phonologies, i.e. distinct computational systems that apply to strings according to their morphological composition (class 1 vs. class 2 affixes). An alternative that works with just one computational system has been proposed by Halle & Vergnaud (1987 et passim): the central tool is selective spell-out, i.e. the idea that only a subset of nodes (phase heads in syntactic terminology) is actually spelled out. Kaye (1992,1995) has supplemented selective spell-out with a ""freezing"" no look-back device that inhibits the modification of previously interpreted strings (this is Chomsky's PIC).

Since the PIC and morpheme-specific phonologies do the same labour in the analysis of affix class-based phenomena (they organize underapplication), no theory can afford to accommodate both: this would be redundant. If syntactic phase theory is on the right track, then, present and past solutions that rely on morpheme-specific phonologies do not qualify: the PIC must exist in phonology.

Finally, it is shown that Kaye's system also implements in phonology what is known as the phase edge in syntax (the sister of phase heads, not their maximal projection, is spelled out).",1
"The aim of this paper is to investigate the interfacing both of the lexicon/ morphology with syntax and of morphosyntax with LF on the basis of data concerning the middle-passive voice of Albanian dialects and of Modern Greek (henceforth Greek). The same general problem of non-isomorphism between form and meaning can be observed both at the level of single lexical items, in cases of syncretism, and at the level of entire structures, at the LF interface. In this perspective, we consider syncretisms involving middle-passive forms of Geg Albanian dialects in section 2, while in section 3 we consider the different morphosyntactic instantiations of the middle-passive voice in Greek. In the light of these data we argue against Interface Uniformity and in favor of a unified morphosyntax (that restricts interpretation).",0
"This paper has two main theoretical aims: (i) to argue for the utility of a lexical, feature-based, approach to intra-dialectal and inter-dialectal language

variation, confirming and extending Borers (1984, 251254) suggestion that

language variation is ultimately a matter of the properties of the lexicon of

functional categories; (ii) to argue that the variability found in an individual

speaker is two-dimensional: it may involve varying featural specification

of functional categories and/or underspecification in the mapping between

these categories and morphological forms, the former modeling the kind of variation usually thought of as parametric and the latter modeling the kind

of variation usually captured by the notion of linguistic variable (Labov 1994,

Labov 2000). We thus offer a unified model of the grammatical representations

that underlie language variation of both types.",0
"In this paper I discuss the morphology of local cases based on results of a survey of 62 languages. I propose a non-linear structure of the local case affixes, which has two main components: Location and Mode. Unlike some previous works (Koopman 2002, den Dikken 2006), I argue that both components are always present in the structure. Moreover, I suggest that the terminal nodes that are dominated by Location and Mode include Place and Distal and Motion, Orientation and Aspect, respectively. The arguments in favor of the non-linear organization of the local case affixes come from two sources: portmanteau morphemes and implicational universals.",0
"This work investigates phenomena involving ""uninterpretable"" phi-features to explore the character of syntax as a module both highly autonomous of the systems with which it interfaces, yet sensitive to the requirement of providing them with legible objects. Three findings are presented, developed in the perspective of the Minimalist Program of Chomsky (1995): 

-Uninterpretable phi phenomena support the modular organization of the grammar, whereby syntax is autonomous of morphophonology (less strongly, of interpretation). 

-Person-hierarchy interactions between arguments indicate that both morphophonology and syntax are responsible for some ""uninterpretable"" phi phenomena, creating two classes with distinct properties predicted by the autonomy of syntax. 

-Certain syntactic uninterpretable phi phenomena, namely person hierarchy interactions and dependent Case, suggest that uninterpretable phi-features enter an autonomous syntax as a last-resort response to the need to converge at the interface with external systems. This makes for a potential source for uninterpretable features in general.",0
"The hypothesis of Clitic Idiosyncrasy holds that special clitics are neither words nor affixes, but constitute a separate type of object whose behaviour is partly governed by dedicated grammatical mechanisms. In an influential implementation of this idea, Judith L. Klavans and Stephen R. Anderson claim that special clitics are phrasal affixes, introduced by a set of postlexical morphological rules that is separate from stem- and word-level morphology. This paper criticizes the hypothesis of Clitic Idiosyncrasy and its implementation through phrasal affixation. First, we show that the identification of a distinct class of special clitics depends on a concept of special syntax that is not well-defined: in many instances, there are syntactically autonomous units that exhibit the same behaviour as putative special clitics. Secondly, we note that the theory of phrasal affixation incorrectly predicts that special clitics will be invisible to lexical morphophonology. Thirdly, we demonstrate that, in certain crucial cases, phrasal affixation cannot place special clitics in the right positions: in Bulgarian, for example, the definiteness marker is suffixed to the head of the first syntactic phrase immediately contained within the NP. We show that this behaviour is straightforwardly handled by a theory of syntactic feature-passing within subtrees that allows phrasal features to be transferred now to heads, now to edges. This theory is independently motivated by phenomena such as the English s genitive and Old Georgian Suffixaufnahme.",0
"In this paper, we attempt to revive the mechanism of variable rules from

sociolinguistics within the theoretical framework of Distributed

Morphology. We argue that leveling variation, or non-categorical

paradigm syncretism, is well modeled as the variable application of post-syntactic phi-feature deleting Impoverishment operations. We claim,

moreover, that certain morphosyntactic features and combinations are

inherently marked, and that this markedness is what triggers

Impoverishment rules in the morphology, resulting in variable

syncretism. The main substance of our paper consists of three case

studies, wherein we show that the markedness of a particular

morphosyntactic feature causes variable Impoverishment rules to apply,

yielding the observed patterns of syncretism. First, in Monmouthshire,

Wales, the marked feature [+Author] is responsible for variable leveling

to the plural form 'be' in the 1st person, as in 'I be (am) proud of myself'.

Second, in Buckie, Scotland, the marked feature [+Participant] causes a

split pattern of variable leveling to the singular form 'was' in the 1st

person, as in 'We was (were) laughing at each other', but not in the 3rd

person, as in 'They were (*was) laughing at each other'. Third, in Smith

Island, Maryland, the marked feature [+Negation] results in variable

leveling to the plural form 'werent', as in 'She werent (wasnt) scared', as

well as leveling to the form 'aint' across the entire agreement paradigms

of present tense 'be' and 'have'.",0
"In contrast to GB where the completed morpho-syntactic derivation was merely dumped into PF and (LF) with a ""good bye and don't come back"", phase theory establishes a two-way pipe between the morpho-syntactic and the phonological (and semantic) module. Actors on both ends are not free anymore to do what they want: their theories and analyses may make predictions on the other end. Intermodular argumentation in a phase-based architecture can thus build on the logical fact that interpretational units -- the pieces which are designated for spell-out -- must be the same in morpho-syntax and in phonology. Intermodular argumentation probably provides stronger evidence than what can be produced by modular-internal reasoning: it offers the maximal degree of independent assessment that linguists can expect without leaving their discipline. The intermodular argument that is made in this paper concerns the phase edge: in current syntactic phase theory, only the complement of (the head of) the phase head is actually interpreted. In other words, the sister of X° is spelled out. Based on phonological evidence of cyclic spell-out, a number of theories have been proposed which have variable takes on how spell-out works. Among these, only one -- Kaye (1995) -- spells out the sister of interpretation-triggering affixes. The point that is made, then, is that only this phonological theory is able to offer a unified spell-out mechanism for syntactic and phonological effects of the same thing: cyclic derivation. This is how syntax can referee the competition of phonological theories. Finally, an issue is discussed that appears to stand in the way of a uniform spell-out mechanism: in syntax phasehood is a property of node labels (node-driven phase), while in phonology node labels are irrelevant: nodes inherit phasehood, which is a lexical property of affixes (piece-driven phase). It is pointed out that den Dikken's (2007) Phase Extension is a step in the direction of piece-driven phase.",0
"This paper investigates the determiner systems of three unrelated languages (Blackfoot, German, and Halkomelem). It is shown that the features encoded in determiners vary within and across languages in content, distribution, and spell-out properties. It is argued that the distributional differences are best understood as being a reflex of the familiar difference between heads and modifiers. It is thus argued that features are to be viewed as regular linguistic objects which participate in the syntactic operation MERGE. Furthermore, it is argued that the spell-out differences of determiner features can be accounted for if we recognize a distinction between early and late insertion of functional morphemes.",0
"This book argues against a macroparametric approach to non-configurationality, showing how non-configurational properties are best analysed via a conspiracy of microparameters. The approach developed has consequences for the theory of phrase structure, specifically the untenability of remnant/roll-up derivations for apparent rightward specifier structures and the utility of Mirror Theoretic perspectives on phrase structure, the morphology-syntax interface and the syntax-semantics interface.",0
"This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of the facts of anticausativization, the phenomenon whereby an inchoative verb is morphologically derived from its causative counterpart (e.g., Spanish romper break (trans) versus romperse break (intrans)). It treats the phenomenon as reflexivization (Chierchia 2004), providing a number of new arguments for this kind of treatment, and showing how it, as opposed to alternatives in the literature, accounts for the wide range of data reviewed. In addition, the facts laid out show that inchoatives derived from causatives retain the CAUSE operator present in the lexical semantic representation of the causative verb from which they are derived, contrary to the widely held view of anticausativization as a process that deletes a CAUSE operator. In this way, it is shown that anticausativization does not provide an argument against the Monotonicity Hypothesis, the idea that word formation operations do not delete operators from lexical semantic representations.",1
"This paper discusses NP-licensing (abstract Case) and morphological case, arguing that there is no direct relationship between these two important phenomena, the syntactic relations (Voice-matching, v-matching, etc.) that underlie morphological case-marking of core arguments being distinct from those that have commonly been analyzed as Case (finite Tense-matching, Person matching). One of the ideas pursued is that defective v (yielding NOM) is derived (under Voice control) from either v* (yielding ACC) or v** (yielding inherent case), and that NOM is no case or null case, inactive until in agreement morphology. The analysis also suggests a link between ergative and accusative systems via Voice. In both accusative and ergative systems, finite Tense/Person-matching licenses overt subjects, while Voice/v-matching licenses N(P) case interpretation in morphology in terms of discrete features like +ACC and +ERG, such features being non-existent in syntax. Linguistic mapping processes are fundamentally non-isomorphic, there thus being no one-to-one mappings from syntax onto morphology or onto PF in general. However, there is no escape from the dilemma that internal language can only be studied through the incomplete reflection of externalized language (Platos cave allegory).",0
"Icelandic DAT-NOM constructions generally observe the Person Restriction, allowing only 3rd person NOM to control agreement. This can be illustrated with English glosses:



(i)

a. /him.DAT have.3PL always liked they.NOM/ = He has always liked them.

b. */him.DAT have.1PL always liked we.NOM/



In addition, however, there is variation within the 3rd person, one variety (Icelandic C) allowing only the default 3SG form of the verb (i.e., generally disallowing agreement), another variety (Icelandic B) generally disallowing 3rd person agreement with NOM across an overtly intervening DAT, and a third variety (Icelandic A), allowing many but not all instances of 3rd person agreement across DAT.



We develop a unified analysis of the Person Restriction, blocking 1st and 2nd person agreement in cases like (ib), and the 3rd person agrement variation. The analysis is based on the hypothesis that interpretable (but unvalued) Person and Number are separate probes (heads) in the clausal structure.",0
"This article introduces the grammatical framework of Distributed Morphology (DM), with special attention to the implications of the framework for semantic interpretation. The derivation of a sample sentence is given, illustrating the dissociation between the semantically contentful abstract units which are the input to syntactic and semantic composition, and the phonologically contentful Vocabulary Items which compete to realize them. The central assumptions of the framework are contrasted with those of more established Lexicalist approaches, particularly with respect to the predictions for bracketing paradoxes, the Mirror Principle and the status of lexical roots. Areas in which Distributed Morphology has developed semantic proposals are described, including argument structure operations, idiomatic interpretation, the interpretation of nominal features, and the nature of on-line speech errors.",0
"This Tromso PhD thesis shows that the many morphemes of a Kitharaka (Bantu) verb can be elegantly understood if they are syntactic objects undergoing phrasal movements of the type proposed in Cinque's U20 papers.



The empirical starting point of the disseration is the observation that there is a tension between morpheme order (linearity) and the scopal/compositional status of the morpheme (semantics): scope suggests one hierarchy, linear order suggest another. Taking scope/compositionality as indicative of the underlying hierarchical structure, the surface order must be derived by reordering. As it turns out, the kind of displacements needed are exactly the phrasal movements suggested by Cinque's U20.
Furthermore, the overall type of phrasal-structure revealed resembles the usual verbal functional sequence, again suggesting that the morphemes of Kitharaka (Bantu) verbs are expressions of the usual functional heads (aspect, agent, etc)",0
"In this paper, I provide a novel account of the IPP-effect (infinitivus pro participio) in German. It is argued to result from a repair operation which involves the copying of formal/semantic features of affixes that get displaced in the functional structure that is shared by verb formation and verb cluster formation. The account questions the commonly held assumption that morphology simply interprets syntactic output, as in distributed morphology, and calls for a bidirectional mapping between syntax and morphology.",0
"This contribution calls attention to the intermodular potential of the interactionist architecture that multiple spell-out (Uriagereka 1999) and derivation by phase (Chomsky 2000, 2001 et seq.) have introduced. The shipping back and forth of pieces between (morpho-)syntax and the PF/LF interfaces during the derivation of a sentence establishes a pipe between the concatenative and the interpretational devices that did not exist in GB or earlier versions of the inverted T-/Y-architecture. It creates a situation where syntactic theories and analyses may have direct consequences on the phonological side, and vice versa.

I submit that intermodular argumentation provides stronger evidence than what can be produced by modular-internal reasoning: it offers the maximal degree of independent assessment that linguists can expect without leaving their discipline. Be it only for that reason, the new interactionist architecture that the minimalist orientation has installed is a good thing to have: after a long period of quasi-silence, syntacticians and phonologists can talk again about things not concerning the weather or job openings. This is one goal of the paper, which will be briefly illustrated by two case studies where syntax can be argued to act as a referee for competing phonological theories (the PIC and the phase edge).

The other goal is to make the conditions of intermodular argumentation explicit: what it can do, want it cannot do, and what it can do only if this or that question is settled beforehand. As far as I can see, much of the intermodular refereeing potential unfortunately hinges on a question that is subject to much ongoing debate: whether morphology is just the lower part of syntax, or whether it is a computational system in its own right that builds hierarchical structure which is distinct from syntactic structure. Depending on this question is the number of spell-out mechanisms that exist in grammar, which, as we will see, is critical for the comparison of phonological and syntactic effects of cyclic spell-out. That is, if it turns out that morphology and syntax are two distinct computational systems, it could be argued with some right that each system comes with its own spell-out mechanism. Note, however, that this is not a necessary conclusion: two distinct structures may as well be 'harvested' by the same mechanism. On the other hand, in case morphology and syntax are found to be emanations of one and the same computational system, there is of course no room for two distinct spell-out mechanisms.

The reason why the number of spell-out mechanisms matters is a massive empirical asymmetry that has been encoded in phonological theories of the interface without, however, having been made explicit as such. I call this phenomenon the word-spell-out-mystery which  in a nutshell  is about the absence of phonological effects of the cyclic spell-out of words and larger chunks (against the plethoric phonological traces of the cyclic spell-out of morphemes). There is no good reason for this asymmetry: nobody doubts that spell-out itself is cyclic  whatever the size of the chunks in question. Why, then, should an interpretational system (phonology) be sometimes impacted by the cyclic (wave )structure of what it receives, but at other times simply ignore it? The null hypothesis is certainly that cyclic chunk-submission will leave traces in whatever (system) is exposed to its piecemeal fire. On this count, sub-word phonology is normal, but word phonology is weird.",0
"Romanian pronominal plural clitics differ from their singular clitic counterparts in that they exhibit dative-accusative case syncretism. This contrast correlates with an asymmetry in the combinatorial possibilities of plural vs singular clitics: namely, plural clitics in direct object position in Romanian affect the acceptability of clitic clusters, as confirmed in quantitative acceptability judgements with multiple informants. Rather than invoking a new Number Case Constraint governing the distribution of clitics, we link the Romanian data to familiar facts from Leista dialects of Spanish, which manifest case syncretism between dative and animate accusative 3rd person clitics. We implement the fact that 1st and 2nd person plural clitics in Romanian are case-syncretic by implicationally marking them as inherently [+animate] in the syntax. The severe degradation of clusters with direct object plural clitics is accounted for by following aspects of Adger & Harbours (2007) proposal for the connection between syncretism and the Person Case Constraint.",0
"In this paper I propose a new cyclic agree analysis of long-distance agreement (LDA). The analysis rests upon the idea that specificity, which is arguably one of the main basic concepts of morphological theory, is at work in syntactic derivations, too. In the new analysis, LDA is the result of ordered operation application at an extremely local level conditioned by a specificity condition, the Maximize Matching Principle, which is an extension of Chomsky's (2001) Maximize Matching Effects Condition. The new analysis accounts for a number of properties of LDA: It captures the parasitic nature of the construction (matrix V can only show LDA if embedded V shows local agreement), offers a principled explanation for the non-intervening embedded external argument, accounts for the blocking of LDA in the presence of left-peripheral material, derives scope effects, and is flexible enough to account for cross-linguistic variation. The new analysis also allows for a new perspective on the relation between LDA and topicality in Tsez: I argue that LDA is not dependent on topicality, but that both the topic interpretation and LDA fall out as a side effect of V-to-I movement.",0
"Crosslinguistic as well as intralinguistic comparisons of pairs of

constructions often reveal a specific type of variation in form, namely pairs

of expressions that seem to yield the same interpretation even though they

differ in their forms. In other words, judging by one member of such pairs,

the interpretation of the other member does not seem to be computed in

parallel with its syntactic derivation. In this paper, we look at some of these

cases and propose to derive this variation using the theory of nonsimultaneous

spell-out (Maru¹iè 2005).",0
"Five grammatical processes targeting heads are rolled into one operation (COMBINE) applying in a single cycle to simultaneously derive phrasal syntactic structures and the morphosyntactic marking of them.  The five are Affix Hopping, Morphological Lowering, Verb or Head Raising, and less obviously, Adverb Placement and the basic Merge operation.  Mirror effects arise under COMBINE but are size-relative, because COMBINE is parameterized for the size of the targeted head, where the values are 'XP', 'X', 'stem', and 'root'.",0
"When adjectives co-occur in pre-nominal position, they typically exhibit the same inflection. In German, there is one much-discussed exception to this. In the dative masculine euter, a strong adjective may be followed by either a strong or a weak adjective: with good red wine may appear as (A) ""mit gut-em rot-em Wein"" or (B) ""mit gut-em rot-en Wein"". This paper reviews some of the literature on this phenomenon and points out that there are actually three dialects: (i) either both (A) and (B) are equally fine; (ii) (A) is preferred over (B); or (iii) (B) is better than (A). After critiquing Schlenkers (1999) morphological account, it is proposed that this alternation is due to a phonological rule. This discussion is then extended to indefinite pronoun constructions like ""mit jemandem anderem"" with somebody different, which also show a lot of variation. It is suggested that the variation on the adjective also follows from this phonological rule but that the variation on the pronoun is a reflex of ""jemand"" belonging to three different inflectional paradigms in the contemporary language. One of the main conclusions of the paper is that the strong/weak alternation in German is a reflex of several mechanisms.",0
"This paper gives an explicit theory of possible feature structures, taking as a core hypothesis the idea that Merge is the sole source of structure embedding in human language. Given the further assumptions that lexical items are composed of features, and are the input to Merge, it follows that features cannot themselves involve structure embedding, contrary to what is usually assumed in HPSG, LFG, FUG. I call this the No Complex Values Hypothesis. I develop a fairly explicit theory of feature structures based on this hypothesis and show how it restricts the range of analyses available for selectional phenomena.

"Partitive constructions express part-whole relations as in the English phrase 'two slices of cake'. There has been continuing debate about how to treat such phrases syntactically and semantically.  That is, which of the partitive construction's constituents is dominant: the 'part' expression 'two slices' or the 'whole' expression 'cake'?



We propose that the syntactic structures of partitive and non-partitive noun

phrases in Turkish are identical, and that consequently, the dominant constituent for both is the head of the structurally higher NP. For partitives, this higher head of NP corresponds to the 'part' expression.



In Turkish, the NP of both partitives and simple, nonpartitive clauses is the

complement of a functional Case head: K. For all partitives, the part expression serves as the head of this complement NP. Internal to this NP, an NP corresponding to the 'whole' expression is generated and moved to the specifier position of the Case Phrase, or KP, for case licensing.



Evidence is drawn from our fieldwork on specificity, word order, and the

distribution of case in Turkish. Alternative semantic and morphosyntactic theories of incorporation and partitivity are considered but found inconsistent with our data.",0
"This dissertation is a theoretical investigation of the thesis of Minimalist Interfaces, namely, that syntax-external linguistic interfaces that interact with the core syntactic computation and language-independent sound and concept systems play a more critical role in manipulating syntactic objects to make them legible to those systems than is currently assumed in recent minimalist inquiry. The core theme of this thesis lies in the idea that syntax is not entirely crash-proof but could make a variety of derivational mistakes; phonological and semantic linguistic interfaces conduct a handful of independent domain-specific operations to attempt to legitimize illicit syntactic objects, if any, for the purposes of legibility at the language-external sound and concept systems. Evidence is provided that the syntax-external components use whatever resources they can to repair certain imperfections created by syntax but only within the range of options made available by the universal principles of syntax in tandem with the language-specific parameter values. This dissertation explores some of the ramifications and empirical consequences of this thesis based on the comprehensive description of a sizable portion of the grammar of Indonesian and Javanese collected by my fieldwork with three native Indonesian and Javanese consultants. Phenomena discussed here include the distribution of active voice morphology, P-stranding under sluicing, the denotation and morphosyntax of bare nominals, wh-in-situ questions, and reduplication asymmetries between nominal and verbal derivational affixes. These diverse ranges of phenomena in the two languages are analyzed in depth to provide converging evidence that the thesis of minimalist interface as defined above yields a deep understanding of the way the syntax interacts with the language-dependent interfaces responsible for phonological and semantic interpretation. The investigation conducted here necessitates serious reconsideration of the commonly held view of linguistic interfaces as passive, merely ornamental components of natural language grammar ruled by the universal law of syntax.",1
"This paper argues that syntax has no case features, case instead being an interpretative feature or features operative in the PF morphology of individual languages, where it overtly distinguishes between arguments (or NPs). The paper also argues that the non-syntactic nature of case is to be expected, given Non-Isomorphism, that is, the fundamental non-isomorphic nature of the derivation. Nonetheless, the different PF case-marking strategies in different languages operate on the basis of common syntactic matching relations, including matching of Voice and marked little v. The dependency of structural accusative upon structural nominative (the Sibling Correlation / Burzios Generalization) is accounted for in terms of double versus single Voice matching.",0
"We discuss the relative order of the operations of cliticization, dissimilation, Linearization, Vocabulary Insertion, and morphological metathesis. We demonstrate a number of crucially ordered feeding and bleeding relations - in some cases leading to opacity - among morphological operations responsible for word-formation in the Basque auxiliary complex. The results argue for a multistratal derivational theory of inflectional word formation, in which separate modules have their own well-formedness principles and repair operations, sometimes in patent contradiction to the needs of one another. Their sequenced interaction is governed by a principled division between operations sensitive to hierarchical versus linear order.",0
"This paper provides a detailed description and analysis of Ulwa (Misumalpan; Nicaragua) verb 

class morphology. Taking as a point of departure the previous literature on the topic (Hale 

and Salamanca 2002; Hale and Keyser 2002; Juarros 2003), it is shown that the facts are more 

complicated than has previously been appreciated, and that previous theoretical claims based 

on facts from the language are not justified. The verb class markers -ta and -pa, I argue, 

are verbalizers of precategorial roots, while da and wa are shown to serve, among other 

functions, as anticausativizers. The contrast in the two broad classes of verb class marker is 

shown to have significant consequences for the lexical semantics, syntax, and morphology of 

verbs in the language, leading to an understanding of a range of previously poorly understood 

and undocumented facts of the language.",0
"In this MA thesis I will show that many issues regarding the internal structure of Zulu DPs can be explained following Kaynes antisymmetry.  However, this can only be done if we abandon the notion that words are syntactic heads.  I will describe amongst other things relative clauses, possessives and the locative construction. All these constructions I describe involve words that are not heads.  In some cases words do not even correspond to a syntactic constituent. So we can only follow Kaynes antisymmetry if we assume that in Zulu, word is not a syntactic concept.",0
"This is in essence a short survey of compounds in Hebrew, and their similarities and differences with construct state nominals.  Theoretically, the paper proposes a principled approach to the interaction between syntactic word formation and the emergence of non-compositional meaning, by defining, and narrowing down, the syntactic domain that can serve as an input to encyclopedic searches.  A longer version is in the pipelines.",0
"This paper is a study on the features and heads that determine countability in the Dutch DP. More specifically, I will discuss the morphosyntax of two types of count readings: the kind reading (1) and the unit reading (2). 



1)	chocolades

	chocolate-PL

	kinds of chocolate.



2)	chocola-tje-s.

	chocolate-DIM-PL

	pieces of chocolate.



To account for these data, I propose that countability is derived from two syntactic features. The first one is the dividing feature [Div] that has been proposed by Borer (2005). It divides stuff into countable items. The second feature is [Size]. It assigns size to stuff and creates measurable portions.  I show that (i) the absence of both features yields the default mass reading, (ii) that the presence of [Div] in the absence of [Size] results in count kind readings, (iii) that the presence of both features generates count unit readings and (iv) that the presence of [Size] in the absence of [Div] is illicit. I further propose that the diminutive is an overt realization of [Size].",0
"The shape of manner how varies to a considerable extent across Scandinavian dialects, and many of the forms quite clearly have a complex internal structure. This paper investigates the internal structure of these many forms, and it will be argued that all forms of complex manner how can be derived from just two abstract templates. Furthermore, it will be shown that the complex forms of manner how unlike the simplex ones interact with other wh-items morphologically speaking: the wh-part will always be identical to the degree wh-item in the various varieties, which in turn will be identical in form to either where or what. The few simplex forms that exist are identical to degree how, but do not share internal structure (apart from wh-) with other wh-items. Moreover, many of the complex forms of manner how are also used as determiners, and a comparison with complex wh-determiners will reveal that at a certain level of abstraction such wh-items share important parts of structure.",0
"This paper examines the nature of morphological roots in relation to their syntactic context. The evidence of doublets suggests that roots do not carry selectional features or class diacritics. Relying on the distinction between syntactic nodes and their exponents, I argue that the syntactic atoms corresponding to root nodes are associated with open-class exponents but not with a meaning that might select a syntactic context. ""Lexical"" meaning arises constructionally, and so do lexical features like gender or class, which however emerge at Vocabulary insertion and may display selectional properties. Content and exponence of roots are thus dissociated. This predicts the existence of root-like elements with mixed status, namely open-class exponents used as grammatical morphemes (like auxiliaries or classifiers), or category-free root extensions below the innermost category-assigning head (like de- in de-struction).",0
"In the present paper, data are arranged around Mandarin proximal demonstratives, colour terms and numerals (Num). I show that language-internal parameters,like crosslanguage parameters are also rooted in the lexicon: the complexity of different lexical items (i.e. the derivation history of a phrase) decides their own syntactic distribution. It is not the case that as long as it is a demonstrative it can then precede a numeral. A phrase can precede a Num if and only if it is derived in such a way that allows it to enter a derivation that finally leads to a higher-than-Num position. There isn't a primitive like basic order in syntax. 

A conjecture of a restricted set of movements that is applied in derivations is suggested, in which system, a fixed functional hierarchy is NOT a primitive.",0
"The overt realization of sentence negation is variously realized across different languages and even languages that share many common features often differ with respect to the structural position where the negative marker surfaces. This variation raises the question of whether those surface differences have an effect at LF. In order to try to answer this question, this paper will explore the possibility that the PF-realization of negation corresponds to its logic scope. This hypothesis will be tested against modal constructions, showing that surface variations of NegP are not relevant in the computation of the scope of negation with respect to intentional operators. Direct empirical support for the possibility to covert move negation at LF will be given considering double modal constructions in German.",0
"Indonesian presents the first genuine counterexample to the P-Stranding Generalization proposed by Merchant (2001) in favor of his wh-movement + TP deletion approach to sluicing constructions as a non-P-stranding language that allows P-stranding only under sluicing. Arguments based on the distribution of the question marker -kah (Fortin (2007)) and the lack of the complementizer yang in wh-questions are presented to show that the sluicing construction with PP remnants in Indonesian is derived by regular wh-movement as in English. Based on this discovery, a new parametric theory of the three-way contrast among English, Indonesian, and French with respect to P-stranding is proposed that draws on independently motivated assumptions concerning the percolation of the [+wh] feature onto the PP and the D-to-P incorporation for the purposes of D-P coalescence. 	The proposed theory adopts the recent idea of interface repair that has been developed in recent research as in Merchant (2001), Lasnik (1999, 2001, 2005), Boeckx and Lasnik (2006), and others. The proposed analysis provides strong evidence that the syntax-external phonological component conducts several domain-specific operations they avail of to legitimatize an otherwise illegitimate syntactic object but only within the range of options that is parametrically set by a particular language.",0
"This article proposes an account within the framework of Distributed Morphology for English compounding, including synthetic compounds, root (primary) compounds, and phrasal compounds. First a summary of the framework is provided. Then, an analysis is proposed according to which compounds are incorporation structures, where non-head nouns incorporate into the acategorial root of the head noun, prior to its own incorporation into its category-defining n° head.",0
"In this paper, I investigate the issue of the proper division of labor between syntax and lexicon with a case study in phrasal compounding in English, Dutch, and Afrikaans. I show that examination of this type of compound poses non-trivial architectural and/or empirical difficulties for several existing variants of the lexicalist theory as in Chomsky (1970), Anderson (1982, 1992), Kiparsky (1982), Mohanan (1986), Di Sciullo and Williams (1987), and Bresnan and Mchombo (1995) because the formation of such a compound crucially requires application of regular/compositional syntactic processes to be followed by/interact with the lexical process of compounding. I argue that the Multiple Spell-Out model of syntax, as recently proposed by Uriagereka (1999) and Johnson (2003), provides a straightforward reduction of this type of compounding as a special case of regular compounding as in black board and nurse shoes. To the extent that this analysis is tenable, the current investigation provides support for the recent, non-lexicalist architecture of the lexicon-syntax interface as in Distributed Morphology that attempts to localize all types of word formation within the sole realm of syntax and for the recent derivational approach to syntax.",1

"Bororo has around 700 speakers, living in five villages in the region of Rondonópolis, MT. It is the last living language of the Bororoan family (the others, according to Kaufman (1994) were Umutina, whose last speaker died recently, Otuké, and a supposed dialect called West Bororo).  

This dissertation begins with a brief introduction (section 1) and a summary of the activities developed in the field (section 2). After that, it concentrates on its two main subjects: in the first part (section 3), it is a descriptive grammar of Bororo and, in the second (section 4), it proposes a theoretical model based on the data from this language. At last, it includes three appendixes: a Bororo-Portuguese lexicon (Appendix 1), the sentences elicited in the field (Appendix 2) and the stories collected and analyzed (Appendix 3).

The grammar in section 3 employs mostly the terms from the grammar tradition that comes from the Greeks. Symbolism of the generative grammar is used only in some parts that it allowed to present in a more elegant a precise way.

The model presented in the second part of this dissertation is based on the theory sketched in Chomsky (2000, 2001). Given the evidence that this theory doesn't account for the phenomena of case, agreement and movement of Bororo, some revisions are proposed in order to, essentially, rescue head movement to the syntax (head movement had been left to PF by Chomsky 2001), linking it explicatively to the phenomena of case and agreement and argument movement. Besides accounting for the data of an ergative active language as Bororo, this model is extended to other systems of case and agreement (ergative and accusative alike) and explains Holmberg Generalization.",1
". This article discusses a syntactic puzzle posed by Hale (2002); namely, 
the variation in the location of agreement morphology in reduced object-relative 
clauses. The contribution of this paper is the proposal that phi features are 
uniformly on the super-ordinate D, and the micro-variation in the location of 
agreement morphology is an outcome of the difference in the adjunction site of 
the extracted object. This analysis makes predictions for subject relatives as well 
as non-reduced relative clauses. The major theoretical implication of this paper is that clause-external phi features are responsible not only for genitive subject-case licensing but also for overt subject-verb agreement in reduced and non-reduced relative clauses.",0
"This paper proposes an analysis of the distribution of the active voice (AV) morphology in two Javanic languages within the Phase Theory (Chomsky 2004). Cole and Hermon (1998) propose that the movement of an NP cannot cross the verb marked with the AV in Indonesian. I show that this generalization also holds for Javanese. Following Kaynes (1989) analysis of French participial agreement, I propose that the deletion of the AV morphology in the two languages is a PF reflex of the Spec-Head D-feature checking relation between the moved NP and its local v. The phenomenon investigated here provides syntax-external support for the phase-based implementation of successive cyclicity in terms of vP phases. I further situate the proposed analysis within the broader context of Austronesian by bringing in the data from Chamorro and develop a micro-parametric account of the common Austronesian grammatical design concerning the syntax-morphology interface.",0
"One prominent interpretation of the competence-performance distinction in linguistics is that the grammar is a knowledge base consulted by the performance systems.

"In this paper, we propose a comprehensive account of the syntax of Sino-Japanese reflexive verbs with the recent decompositional approach to argument structure as in Hale and Keyser (1993, 2002), Harley (1995), and Harley and Noyer (2001). Contra Tsujimura and Aikawas (1999) unaccusative analysis of object-less reflexive verbs, we provide a variety of syntactic and morphological arguments for the three-way contrast among object-less zi-verbs; a) verbs such as zi-ritu-suru establish oneself and zi-satu-suru kill oneself are transitive predicates, b) verbs such as zi-si-suru commit suicide and zi-sui-suru cook ones own food are unergative predicates, and c) verbs such as zi-kai-suru demolish oneself and zi-baku-suru explode itself are unaccusative predicates. We also briefly discuss inalienable zi-verbs and show that the proposed syntactic approach sheds a new light on the syntax of this class of verb.",0
"In this paper, I argue against Chierchia¡¯s (1998a, b) Nominal Mapping Parameter (NMP) from Javanese and develop an alternative, purely syntactic account of the effects that the NMP was designed to capture. I first show that Javanese poses an empirical challenge to the NMP because this language does not fit into any one of the three language types that should exhaustively classify all natural languages under Chierchia¡¯s typology. I propose a new parametric syntactic account, whereby languages differ with respect to how high a language allows its bare nominal to grow, drawing on the related ideas independently argued for in recent work as in Grimshaw (1991), Massam (2001), and Guilfoyle and Noonan (1992). I show that this parametric analysis of the height of the nominal functional structure derives a variety of morphosyntactic properties of bare nominals across languages, including those noted by Chierchia, in tandem with the independently motivated language-particular values for Number: {singular, plural} vs. {neutral. plural}.",0

"In this paper, I discuss reduplication in Bahasa Indonesia (BI). The corpus study of four popular newspapers published in Indonesia reveals that there is a curious asymmetry between nominal and verbal reduplication in this language. Specifically, verbal affixes allow only stem reduplication whereas nominal affixes allow both stem and stem-affix reduplication. This asymmetry and the stem-internal reduplication pattern pose non-trivial architectural and empirical challenges for the traditional lexicalist view of the lexicon-syntax interface as in Chomsky 1970, Anderson 1982, Kiparsky 1982/Mohanan 1986, and Di Sciullo and Williams 1987. I propose that these observations receive a straightforward account under the non-lexicalist view of word formation as in Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993). Under the proposed analysis, these patterns can be derived as a natural consequence of a particular hierarchical arrangement of certain morphosyntactic features such as Asp and Num in tandem with independently motivated assumptions concerning the cyclic post-syntactic assignment of phonological features. This result, therefore, provide support for the non-lexicalist view of the lexicon-syntax correspondence that attempts to locate all types of word formation within the sole realm of generative syntax.",1
"The paper challenges the widely accepted belief that the relation between a bound variable pronoun and its antecedent is not necessarily submitted to locality constraints. It argues that the locality constraints for bound variable pronouns that are not explicitly marked as such are often hard to detect because of (a) alternative strategies that produce the illusion of true bound variable interpretations and (b) language specific spell-out noise that obscures the presence of agreement chains. To identify and control for those interfering factors, the paper focuses on fake indexicals, 1st or 2nd person pronouns with bound variable interpretations. Following up on Kratzer (1998), I argue that (non-logophoric) fake indexicals are born with an incomplete set of features and acquire the remaining features via chains of local agreement relations established in the syntax. If fake indexicals are born with an incomplete set of features, we need a principled account of what those features are. The paper derives such an account from a semantic theory of pronominal features that is in line with contemporary typological work on possible pronominal paradigms.",0
"In this paper, I argue for a new, theory-neutral approach to polarity effects in inflectional paradigms resting upon the idea that the choice of marker for a given feature specification is determined by the choice of marker for a minimally different specification. In paradigms instantiating polarity effects, the matching of morpho-syntactic and phonological features proceeds by natural class based-rules, but is partly overriden by two principles, Discreteness of Environment and Minimality, the latter of which is an independently motivated assumption underlying syntactic derivations, and arguably a basic property of language in general.",0

"Anti-agreement is the phenomenon whereby the morphosyntactic form of subject/verb agreement is sensitive to whether or not an agreeing subject has been locally extracted. This paper argues that, together with an anti-locality constraint on movement (following Grohmann 2000, 2003) which prohibits overly local movement as elaborated in (i-v), the occurrence of a canonically left dislocated subject in anti-agreement languages accounts for all syntax peculiar to the phenomenon in the Bantu language of Kinande: (i) subjects can extract long-distance even across islands; (ii) subjects are locally unextractable if the canonical subject/verb agreement occurs; (iii) local subject extraction requires a change in subject/verb agreement morphology; (iv) objects cannot locally extract even if they appear to do so; and (v) objects can extract long-distance; however, they are sensitive to islands. Evidence comes from an analysis of the distribution of nominal expressions in the language as well as in-depth examination of two different wh-question formation strategies in the language. This study also reveals that last resort strategy in a language is relativized to what is first resort: if resumption is first resort, movement is last resort, and vice versa.

It attempts an answer by examining the properties of nominalizations in mainly Greek in comparison to English. 

The main points made here are: first, in cases where nominal affixes attach outside verbalizing affixes, the result meaning is compositional predicted from the meaning of the verb. Second, the presence of AS in nominals should be dissociated from the presence of verbalizing morphology. 

AS in nominals is related to the presence of layers such as VoiceP and predicates/resultative/prepositional phrases  in agreement with 

much recent work.",0
"It is argued that long-distance case assignment does not actually exist.  Unlike long-distance agreement, it would necessarily violate the Phase Impenetrability Condition.  All examples that have been analyzed in terms of long-distance case actually involve the appearance of the nominative as the default case.  Cases that are actually assigned -- the accusative and the non-structural cases -- always obey locality.  Yet assignment of the accusative does appear to violate cyclicity.  This problem can however be solved as well with the right view on when case is assigned, once the dependency between structural accusatives and other DPs is properly understood.  As a result, the alternative solution put forward by Sigurðsson (2006), requiring that subjects first-merge lower than objects, is shown to be unnecessary.",0
"Preface: Thanks to the Archivers who took an interest in the original, written in fall 2002. You may have noticed it had nothing to do with DM. This revision is different in that respect, at least.

ABSTRACT: This paper consists of two main sections. First, I critically evaluate Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1995)s lexical-semantics-based analysis of CHANGE- OF-STATE verbs and their relation to the CAUSATIVE ALTERNATION concluding that the lexical-semantic approach is empirically unmotivated and therefore LEXICAL SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS in the lexicon constitute an unnecessary complication to the grammar. In the second section, adopting their proposal which divides change-of-state verbs into INTERNALLY- and EXTERNALLY-CAUSED EVENTUALITIES (ibid.), I propose a LATE-INSERTION approach (Halle and Marantz, 1993, et seq) for roots participating in the Causative Alternation. Though the claims I make are limited to languages which indicate verbal adicity morphologically since the properties of interest are most transparent in such languages, the result is an analysis more closely aligned with the contemporary syntactic findings of the MINIMALIST PROGRAM (Chomsky, 1995 and 2001, among many), in particular its instantiation as DISTRIBUTED MORPHOLOGY (DM) (Halle and Marantz, 1993 and Embick and Noyer, 2007).",0
"This paper investigates a morpheme central to the clausal syntax of Kiitharaka (SVO, Bantu, E54, Kenyan). The first sections of the paper offer a careful description of three functions of this morpheme, which marks information structure and cyclic movement. We show that the syntactic and semantic properties of the three functions fall into a neat hierarchy. Rather than treating the different uses of the morpheme as distinct, accidentally homophonous items, we suggest an account that needs to postulate only one morpheme, allowing it to realize different amounts of features in its different uses. Building on ongoing work in morphological theory by Starke (class lectures) and Caha (2007), we make the crucial assumption that the features in the lexical entry of a morpheme are hierarchically structured.",1
"Recent DISTRIBUTED MORPHOLOGY (DM), the SINGLE ENGINE HYPOTHESIS (Marantz, 2001 and 2002 and Arad, 2003), claims that the formation of lexical category is a syntactic operation. Nouns, verbs and adjectives do not exist as such, but are formed by merger of a root with the functional heads n, v, and a. These are ROOT-BASED DERIVATIONS and differ in several important ways from the formation of words from preexisting categories, e.g., deverbal and denominal derivations. This article argues that Japanese contains examples of both types, root-based derivations and category change from preexisting words. The Japanese data, therefore, provides an opportunity to clarify the differences between root-based and lexical category-derived word formation.",0
"This  paper is concerned with the status of bound forms in compounds and other lexical items, but it ultimately aims at setting up a hierarchy of lexical items of various degrees of freedom, making use of clear-cut criteria applicable in at least one (fairly large) group of languages. In spite of the difficulties of the various (phonological, morphological, lexical, and semantic) definitions of word, Bloomfields characterization of minimum free forms is applied to designate items at the top of the hierarchy, which are called autonomous words. Bound forms that allow autonomous words to occur between them and the lexical item they are bound to are dependent words. The novelty of this paper lies in dividing the rest of the lexical items 'below', i.e., nonwords, into three groups: semiwords, affixoids, and affixes, based on a new application of a familiar operation, coordination reduction, which is shown to work both backward and forward for some items, but only backward reduction is possible for others.",0
"Non-lexicalist approach to Argument Structure has been gathering much interest with a strong argument against Chomskyan lexicalist approach (Halle and Marantz 1993, Marantz 1997).  In this paper, I put a focus on how a Manner Component is encoded across languages.  Harley (2005, 2007) assumes an operation of Manner Conflation* (in her original term Manner Incorporation), which makes it possible to derive productive denominal verbs (e.g. hammer, anchore, nail, etcc).  I argue that the operation of Manner Conflation can apply to a root which results in semi-productive compound verbs in Japanese (e.g. naki-harasi-ta ecry-cause swollenf).  Furthermore, I propose a Symmetry Condition which describes a symmetrical branching of a terminal node where Manner Conflation (*) applies.  Assuming distinction of the nature of an acategorial root and a category-determining functional head in Distributed Morphology, the parametric realizations of Manner Conflation (to a functional v or to a root) can be explained straightforwardly.  Finally, I argue that a new light can be shed on the cross-linguistic difference in terms of Manner and Path (Talmy 1991, 2001) by the mechanism of Manner Conflation(*) and Symmetry Condition.",0
"This paper discusses the strong and weak endings in the German DP. Arguing that certain instances of the definite and indefinite articles have a null or rather no ending whatsoever, it is proposed that this is a more general phenomenon. Following Wiese (1988), the paper proposes that schwa is not an inflection per se but due to some phonotactic constraint triggered by the presence of an abstract suffix (X). While the elimination of schwa as an ending reduces the number of exponents in the strong and weak paradigms, there are other interesting consequences. For instance, in view of the fact that, on the surface, both certain declinable AND indeclinable elements license split NPs, it is suggested that all these elements have this X in common, which is taken to be responsible for the licensing of the null head noun in the stranded nominal.",0
"This paper presents evidence for the quantity-insensitive (QI) iamb, the existence of which is important because it fills an empirical gap that--while denied by many--is predicted by many extant prosodic theories (e.g. Prince & Smolensky 1993/2004, McCarthy & Prince 1993, Halle & Vergnaud 1987). Moreover, given the standard view that QI trochees exist, QI iambs in Osage show that whether a foot is right or left-headed in a given language is *independent* of whether stress in that language is affected by the moraic make-up of syllables (contra the generally held view). The claim that QI iambs exist is not new, but until now there has been no unambiguous evidence for them. Previously cited cases either do not have a contrast between long and short vowels and/or can be reanalyzed as trochaic (Kager 1989, Hayes 1995). Osage is the first clear case with QI iambic feet.",0

"This paper argues that wordhood in the polysythetic Inuit languages is completely predictable from syntactic structure and that words correspond to the phasal spell out domains of CP and DP. This entails that Inuit does not have a discrete morphological component and that individual morphemes are not idiosyncratically specified as affixes. As evidence for our approach, we contrast a variety of free and bound elements, showing that in every case, subparts of words are smaller than the spell out domains and that full words correspond to these domains. We also discuss ""stem"" ellipsis, which we argue is further evidence that the elements which are usually bound in Inuit languages are not truly affixes.",1
"Since its inception in the late seventies, Case Theory has mostly concentrated on arguments and structural Case. In this paper I discuss Case assignment to predicates and demonstrate that to account for Case-agreement (as in Latin or Icelandic) and the distribution of predicate Cases, it is necessary to assume that Case features are assigned by a head to its complement and percolate down to relevant terminals. As a result, multiple Case features can be assigned to a single constituent, which permits us also to derive the behavior of predicate Case in languages with multiple predicate cases (Russian, Finnish) on the basis of some standard Distributed Morphology assumptions. I show that this hypothesis is sufficient to account for structural Case assignment and for several other multiple Case assignment phenomena.",0
"Cowper (2005) claims that the plural category of number is more marked than

dual, on grounds of explaining syncretism in Zuni pronominal forms. This claim goes against a wide range of typological, diachronic, and developmental evidence for the markedness of dual. However, Cowpers argument conflates markedness of a category with the notion of specification of vocabulary items. On a classical understanding of markedness, even the Zuni facts can be interpreted as evidence for the markedness of dual.",0
"We discuss the syntax and morphology of agreement realization in finite auxiliaries in Basque by conducting a detailed study of the Bizkaian variety of Zamudio. Our main objective is to argue that the proper treatment of Basque verbal morphology must take into account both syntactic and postsyntactic (PF) principles and rules, as delineated in the framework of Distributed

Morphology.



The general theoretical proposals we advance are the following: 

(1) a. The finite auxiliary is a complex that contains ergative, dative, and absolutive clitics. 

b. What is normally referred to as the root of the auxiliary is actually a T head that agrees with the absolutive argument in the clause. 

c. Basque has no third person absolutive clitics.



We show that an analysis along these lines has a number of positive consequences. First, it renders a syntactic Person Case Constraint (PCC) account of Basque clitic combinations otiose. In other

words, contrary to what has been written, Basque does not have a bona fide PCC that disallows the syntactic combination of third person datives and first/second person accusatives. Rather, the apparent Basque PCC falls out from the fact that Basque has only one clitic position for internal arguments, and from the fact that Basque simply has no third person absolutive clitics.



Second, our analysis paves the way for an explanation of ergative displacement as the result of metathesis (cf. Harris and Halle (2005)), which turns out to provide an economical and explanatory account of ergative doubling with the same machinery. Third, our proposal explains

root allomorphy, i.e. the distribution of root morphemes in the auxiliary, in terms of well-known restrictions on the locality of agreement.",0
"This paper addresses suppletion in the formation of the comparative degree of adjectives and related forms. I set forth to investigate and explain two generalizations concerning the distribution of (root) suppletion in forms that (I argue) are related to the comparative, namely, the superlative degree of adjectives and deadjectival change-of-state verbs. The distribution of suppletion in these forms is shown to be parasitic on suppletion in the comparative adjective. I argue that this is best understood if the superlative adjective and the change of state verb are always derived from the comparative adjective, even where this relation is not morphologically transparent. The paper also briefly considers some theoretical implications of this conclusion for morphology (in particular the formal treatment of suppletion) and semantics (the decomposition of superlatives and change of state verbs). In the course of the investigation, what may be a novel poverty-of-the-stimulus type argument is introduced. Due to the severely limited nature of the relevant data in any given language, the generalizations are not significant language-internally but only when considered from a cross-linguistic perspective. That the patterns (but not the individual forms) are stable cross-linguistically and over time suggests that UG is constrained in such a way that the unattested patterns are impossible. The theory presented here has that effect.",0

"Wari', the last viable language of the Chapakuran family of Brazil and Bolivia, manifests a typologically and theoretically interesting construction for expressing intentional states. I refer to this construction as the INTENTIONAL STATE CONSTRUCTION. The special interest of this construction is that it simultaneously manifests properties of both words and clauses, yet seems difficult to subsume under common definitions of Complex Predicates, mixed categories, or within theories of syntax based strictly on endocentricity. It is argued that these constructions are handled straightfowardly by Role and Reference Grammar (Van Valin and LaPolla, 1997), in which they are dominated by a non-projecting node (NUC) heading an exocentric unit, CLAUSE.",0
"In Bare Phrase Structure, nonbranching nodes are impossible (Speas 1986, 1990, Chomsky 1995). In a model-theoretic interpretive semantics for Logical Form, theta-roles are an anachronism and the Theta Criterion a peculiar requirement (Heim and Kratzer 1998). The conjunction of these two positions means that two centrally important paradigms of facts  unaccusativity and one-replacement  become essentially formally untreatable on usual assumptions about category, i.e. that N° and V° are terminal nodes without any internal structure.

In this paper Ill argue that the Distributed Morphology approach to category resolves both these problems, allowing a natural and straightforward updating of the previously standard approaches to the central facts that were proposed when they were first examined. On this approach, the contentful, open-class part of any lexical item such as a noun, verb, or adjective is contributed by an acategorial Root (?), which acquires category by being merged with a particular functional head, v°, n°, a°.",0

"Tashlhiyt Berber uses, among other processes, gemination to form the imperfective. Most accounts of this phenomenon make reference to syllabic or prosodic structure. In this paper, I diverge from this trend, claiming that imperfective gemination is better analyzed as a templatic-based phenomenon resulting from morphological activity at the skeletal tier. I will argue for the use in the imperfective of a fixed-shape template over which consonant gemination is realized. Moreover, I will show that tri-, bi- and monoconsonantal verbs share the same template. The sur- face irregularity that bi- and monoconsonantal verbs display is viewed as the consequence of the identification of templatic positions.",0

"Lardil (Tangkic, Australia) allows nominals to surface with multiple case affixes.  One condition on this case stacking is that when a new Case is added to a nominal with a semantically uninterpretable Case (such as Accusative), the Case is dropped; a nominal with a semantically interpretable Case (such as Instrumental), by contrast, can stack more morphology outside the Case morpheme.  I argue that uninterpretable Cases in these examples are in fact assigned and later eliminated, and develop an approach to Spell-out which allows such derivations to take place, in which PF Spellout and LF Spellout are dissociated.  In this approach, uninterpretable Case features are assigned (crucially, I argue, in the narrow syntax) before Spellout to PF, and then subsequently eliminated before Spellout to LF. I conclude that morphological case may in principle be assigned to a nominal arbitrarily many times.",0
"I claim that the linguistic message that realizes syntax is multichannel. The syntax-PF interface is the interface of syntax with all the sensorimotor systems available to humans, including, for oral languages, minimal vocalic productions, intonation, hand movement and body gestures. I show that the realization of syntactic structure consists of (i) segmental oral morphemes, (ii) non-segmental oral morphemes (intonation), and (iii) non-oral morphemes (segmental or not; hand movements, upper body gestures and face movements). In particular, the latter predicts the use of non-oral morphemes in oral languages, since the speakers of oral languages have it available in their sensorimotor system. I focus on the CP domain of oral languages, and show that its functional projections can be realized by either (i), (ii) and (iii). The empirical body of this article concentrates on the multichannel Q particles in French, Atlantic French and British English.",0
"In this paper, I present a uniform analysis of several cross-linguistic cases of variable outputs in reduplication, focusing primarily on apparent cases of free variation in reduplicated forms of Tagalog and Ndebele verbs. I claim that the reduplicant in these languages is a Lowering morpheme, and I posit a revised theory of post-syntactic Lowering in which multiple levels within a complex head may be targeted as landing sites for a lowering head (cf. Embick and Noyer 2001). This potential variation in post-syntactic hierarchical structure gives rise to the observed surface variations, when combined with a prosodic template model of reduplication (Marantz 1982) and a cyclic view of Vocabulary Insertion under Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993). Furthermore, I illustrate in detail how both syntactic limitations and phonological output constraints (i.e. Optimality Theory, Prince and Smolensky 2004) work together to preclude ungrammatical constructions. In addition, I investigate the interaction of narrow syntactic phase constraints and post-syntactic transformations.",0
"Some recent work has argued from Icelandic agreement patterns that agreement is essentially non-derivational, and involves non-trivial calculations of locality (Chomsky 2001, 2004, 2005; Hiraiwa 2005). Based on new data from Icelandic, I show that the availability of agreement with a Nominative object is in fact restricted by simple locality and has a crucially derivational character. The relevant locality condition must hold at some point in the derivation and is simple in that it does not assume extension or contraction of the relevant probing domain, unlike proposals that explain the apparent optionality of agreement in bi-clausal environments by appealing to optional restructuring {Boeckx 2004, Nomura 2005, Bhatt 2003, Bobaljik2006). More concretely, I argue that Dative intervention effects in Icelandic depend on whether the potential intervener undergoes object shift or it does not. I argue that the locus of agreement is v, whose unvalued phi-features act as a probe. If the potential intervener undergoes object shift, v is free to probe the Nominative object. If object shift is blocked, the intervener is closer to the probing head than the Nominative object and the intervention effect arises.",0
"This paper presents a unified analysis of two puzzles regarding diminutive formation in Brazilian Portuguese (BP). We claim that the quasi-complementary distribution of the two forms of the diminutive, as well as a number of phonological and morphological differences between diminutive suffixation and the canonical suffixation pattern are due to their syntactic structure. The syntactic account ties together the phonological, morphological and semantic facts  and explains the observed overapplication effects without trans-derivational constraints.",0

"This paper is concerned with nominal inﬂection in Classical Sanskrit within the framework of Distributed Morphology. The complex nominal endings of Sanskrit are analysed into morphemes that are inserted into the functional heads n, Num, Gend and Case provided by morphology. The Sanskrit data show that vocabulary insertion depends upon contextual features in such a way that a given morpheme is maximally sensitive both inwards and outwards. It is therefore argued that morphological features are not deleted completely once the vocabulary has been inserted. Furthermore, the analysis oﬀers an account of grammatically driven phonological processes such as vowel lengthening and quantitative ablaut. These morpho-phonological phenomena are assumed to apply at vocabulary insertion and are dealt with by means of rules of exponence.",1
"In Icelandic, accusative case is lost under passivization, but dative is retained. However, a simple distinction between ""inherent"" dative and ""structural"" accusative cannot capture the full range of facts. For one thing, middles, inchoatives, and adjectival passives of dative-taking verbs lose dative, with their thematic argument showing up as a nominative subject, in contrast to the passives. For another thing, there are verbs in Icelandic which take accusative subjects, but no accusative objects remain accusative under passive promotion; this applies even to causative-inchoative pairs in which the inchoative has an accusative subject, providing a minimal pair with the passive of the causative and its nominative subject. I propose an analysis in which both accusative and dative are structural, but dative is assigned lower in the VP than accusative. The middle, which is equally low, disrupts dative assignment, but the passive, which is higher, cannot.",0

"Northern Sámi, a Finno-Ugric language spoken mainly in Northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland, has a system of consonant gradation which affects consonants at the center of a prosodic foot: the coda of the stressed syllable and the onset of the following syllable (stress is always word-initial). Consonant Gradation is illustrated in (1).



(1) a. guolli 'fish' nominative

b. guoli 'fish' accusative



Historically, the alternation was phonologically conditioned (see Sammallahti 1998 for details), but in the modern language, it is morphologized, so that it occurs without any phonologically overt trigger. The form used in the nominative singular (for this class of nouns) is known as the Strong Grade, and the form used in the accusative is known as the Weak Grade.



Northern Sámi has a three-way length contrast in consonants, so that alternations like that in (2) are also found.



(2) a. gol:li 'gold' nominative

b. golli 'gold' accusative



The extra-long consonant center in (2a) is known as Quantity 3 (Q3), while the geminates seen in (2b)  and (1a) are known as Quantity 2 (Q2), and short consonant centers like that in (1b) are known as Quantity 1 (Q1).



The general pattern is the one already illustrated:



(3) a. Strong Grade Q2 --- Weak Grade Q1

b. Strong Grade Q3 --- Weak Grade Q2



Grade constrasts are not always a simple matter of consonant length; the alternations may surface as preaspiration (of stops), preglottalization (of nasals), schwa epenthesis (in heterorganic clusters), and various other manifestations. Furthermore, phonological processes may conspire to obscure the quantity contrast (see Bye 2001). In particular, lengthening processes give rise to Q2---Q2 alternations (where there is no length contrast, but a different phonological manifestation of gradation), Q3---Q1 alternations, and even Q2---Q3 alternations, where the Weak Grade is phonologically longer than the Strong Grade.



In this paper, I discuss the system of Consonant Gradation and its significance for our understanding of morphological paradigms. Consonant Gradation pervades the morphological system of Northern Sámi; it is an important part of the verbal, nominal, and adjectival inflectional systems, as well as interacting with morphological derivation. It affects not only roots, but also derivational suffixes and even some inflectional suffixes. It is phonologically complex, but systematic, affecting even recent loan words. 



Because of the productivity of Consonant Gradation, the system that generates paradigms must be able to effectuate Consonant Gradation; the root alternations in Northern Sámi are not learned by rote, and Bals (2002) has shown that children learn to correctly use the Consonant Gradation process before the age of three (in fact, the phonologically simplest alternation is already being correctly used by the age of two).



I propose that Consonant Gradation be analyzed as an autosegmental morphological process; I consistently represent the Strong Grade as an infixal timing slot, attached to certain suffixes in the inflectional paradigms but also to certain derivational suffixes. The result is an elegant and simple morphology, with the complicated surface pattern being due to the details of how the phonological system handles the extra timing slot.",0

"Spanish has two types of nouns with homophonous singular and plural forms ending in /s/. In pseudoplural nouns like _Carl-o-s_, the number contrast is neutralized in the morphology: the syntactically singular form contains the plural marker /-s/. In athematic nouns like _virus_, the number contrast is neutralized in the phonology through a process of degemination. The distinction between pseudoplural and athematic nouns manifests itself only under stem-based evaluative suffixation: e.g. augmentative _Carl-ot-e_ vs _virus-ot-e_. However, children are almost never exposed to these crucial forms, which have vanishingly low token frequencies; instead, learners of Spanish acquire the pseudoplural/athematic distinction on the basis of language-particular parsing preferences motivated by morphological and phonological properties of the Spanish lexicon. The emergence of the Spanish pseudoplural nouns shows that, during language acquisition, the phonological properties of words can trigger syntax-morphology mismatches. This finding has significant implications for the syntax-morphology interface.",0
"Since Abney (1987), generative syntax has invested much interest in the structure of the Noun Phrase, producing numerous theoretical as well as descriptive studies. Within the field of Scandinavian Noun Phrase studies, Delsing (1993) was a groundbreaking work that has since been followed up by several important studies, including Vangsnes et al. (2003) and Julien (2005). This field of inquiry is enormous and largely unexplored, so, in spite of much progress, it still suffers from both too limited general understanding and much too limited knowledge of facts. This paper purports to partly improve this situation by describing the most central traits of the Icelandic noun phrase, mostly in fairly theory-neutral terms. Three phenomena are studied in particular. 

First, the order of elements in the NP, partly effected by two distinct leftward (Modifer+)Noun movements, to a Spec,G(enitive) position, yielding the type old books her, and/or to a higher, more leftward Spec,D(eterminer) position, yielding, e.g., old books.the.

Second, the adnominal genitive construction, which usually has the order Noun-Genitive, book her, instead of the general Germanic Genitive-Noun order, her book. While the head noun in the Genitive-Noun Construction is blocked from being definite across the Germanic languages considered in this article (*the her book / *her the book / *her book.the), this Genitive Definiteness Blocking often disappears in the Noun-Genitive Construction, which frequently either allows or requires the definite article (book.the her). 

Third, the preproprial article, both in the Noun-Genitive Construction (book.the her Mary  = Marys book) and elsewhere. The plural preproprial articles (or pronouns) are of special interest, because of their rather unusual properties (we Mary = Mary and I, etc.).

I illustrate in some detail that the use of both the definite article in the Noun-Genitive Construction and of the preproprial article is triggered and conditioned by fine grained semantics, suggesting that the NP may have even richer structure than often assumed.",0
"Working within the morphosyntactic framework of Distributed Morphology (DM, Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994) within the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995), this dissertation proposes a new economy constraint on the grammar, MINIMIZE EXPONENCE, which selects the derivation that realizes all its interpretable features with the fewest morphemes.  The purpose of this proposal is to capture the conflicting needs of the grammar to be both maximally contrastive and maximally efficient.  

	I show that the constraint MINIMIZE EXPONENCE has a number of effects on analyses of morphosyntactic phenomena.  I propose that, in order to satisfy MINIMIZE EXPONENCE, the roots in a derivation fuse with the functional heads projected above them, resulting in a simplex head that contains both a root and interpretable features.  Following the tenets of DM, this head is now a target for the process of Vocabulary insertion.  Since the target node contains both content and functional information, so too can Vocabulary Items (VIs) be specified for both types of information.  This allows VIs such as eat and ate to compete with each other.  This competition of forms linked to the same root allows for a new model of root allomorphy within the framework of DM.  In this model of root allomorphy, following proposals by Pfau (2000), VIs that realize roots participate in competition in the same was as do VIs that realize abstract morphemes.  Since root VIs are participating in competition and are specified for both content and formal features, the need for licensing through secondary exponence as proposed by Harley and Noyer (2000) is removed from the framework.  Further, since eat and ate in this model are different VIs with different specifications that compete with each other for insertion, this model of root allomorphy also eliminates the need for readjustment rules as proposed by Halle and Marantz (1993, 1994) and elaborated on by Marantz (1997).  This new model of root allomorphy allows for an account of the blocking of regular inflection in English nominal compounds (e.g. *rats-catcher), which was problematic for theorists working with DM, given the tenets of the framework.

I also show that the fusion of roots and functional elements driven by MINIMIZE EXPONENCE allows for a new account of subcategorization.  The model of subcategorization presented here falls out of the following facts:  1) arguments are introduced by functional heads; 2) those heads fuse with the root they are projected above, resulting in the node containing both the root and the features of the functional heads; 3) since the root now contains both the root and the formal features, the corresponding VI can be specified for both; 4) VIs that realize roots can also be specified for compatibility or incompatibility of the features of the functional heads that license argument structure.  The result here is an underspecification model of subcategorization that predicts a number of behaviors of verbs with respect to their argument structure that it is difficult for a full specification model to account for.  Those include polysemy (I ran the ball to Mary) and structural coercion (I thought the book to Mary).",0
"Russian genitive plural has been a topic of interest to morphological theory because various authors have claimed that its derivation involves some or all of the following grammatical principles:



(1) a. Inflectional paradigms aspire to avoid homophony. The Russian nominative singular and genitive plural endings reflect a transderivational attempt to minimize homophony across inflectional

endings.

b. Inflectional paradigms require transderivational reference: one cannot compute the Russian genitive plural without knowing what the nominative singular ending is.

c. Markedness-based neutralization may not hold: the genitive plural ending in Russian, unlike other oblique plural shows distinct inflection for different genders.



The goal of this paper is to show that, counter to appearances, the Russian genitive plural does not instantiate any of the principles in (1).",1
"This paper discusses the morphosyntactic properties exhibited by existential pivots such as 'a war' in (1)

(1)    There was a war all summer.

In various languages such NPs do not follow general patterns of argument realization. The paper argues that they do not do so because they are not arguments, but rather the main predicates of their constructions. A compositional semantics for existential constructions is provided which builds on but differs from the analysis of Barwise and Cooper 1981, and in which pivots are predicates of domains. This analysis is argued to provide a better understanding of the morphosyntax of existential constructions than analyses based on small clauses or on unaccusativity.",1
"The Japanese causative represents in a very pure form the problem of the morphology/syntax interface. Its three subtypes have attracted more attention and inspired more theoretical proposals than almost any other construction in the language. Analyses of the causative have had a major influence on many foundational aspects of syntactic theory, including control, case marking, clause structure, theta-theory and argument structure, and the morphology-syntax interface. In this paper, I focus on just one aspect of the causative puzzle: In what component of the grammar are the various causatives constructed? It turns out that the answers to many of the other syntactic questions posed by causatives depend on the theoretical choices made in answering this one. The paper opens with a review of the differing implications of lexicalist and non-lexicalist analyses for the architecture of a linguistic model, and then develops the arguments of Miyagawa 1994, 1998 for a unified, Late Insertion treatment of the 'lexical' and productive variants of the causative within the syntax. The domain of attachment of the causative morpheme is argued to determine whether its interpretation must be compositional or may be idiomatic, and whether it exhibits stem-conditioned allomorphy or not.",0
"Prominence hierarchy effects such as the animacy hierarchy and definiteness 

hierarchy have been a puzzle for formal treatments of case since they were first 

described systematically in Silverstein 1976. Recently, these effects have received more sustained attention from generative linguists, who have sought to capture them in treatments grounded in well-understood mechanisms for case assignment cross-linguistically. These efforts have taken two broad directions. In the first, Aissen 1999, 2003 has integrated the effects elegantly into a competition model of grammar using OT formalisms, where iconicity effects emerge from constraint conjunctions between constraints on fixed universal hierarchies (definiteness, animacy, person, grammatical role) and a constraint banning overt morphological expression of case. The second direction grows out of the work of Jelinek and Diesing, and is found most articulated in Jelinek 1993, Jelinek and Carnie 2003, and Carnie 2005. This work takes as its starting point the observation that word order is sometimes correlated with the hierarchies as well, and works backwards from that to conclusions about phrase structure geometries. In this paper, I propose a particular implementation of this latter direction, and explore its consequences for our understanding of the nature of case assignment. If hierarchy effects are due to positional differences in phrase structures, then, I argue, the attested cross-linguistic differences fall most naturally out if the grammars of these languages countenance polyvalent casethat is, assignment of more than one case value to a single nominal phrase.",0
"In modeling the effects of the Person-Case Constraint (PCC), a common claim is that 3rd person ``is not a person"". However, while this claim does work in the syntax, it creates problems in the morphology. For example, characterizing the well-known ``spurious \textit{se} effect"" in Spanish simply cannot be done without reference to 3rd person. Inspired by alternatives to underspecification that have emerged in phonology (e.g. Calabrese 1995), a revised featural system is proposed, whereby syntactic agreement may be relativized to certain values of a feature, in particular, the contrastive and marked values. The range of variation in PCC effects is shown to emerge as a consequence of the parametric options allowed on a Probing head, whereas the representation of person remains constant across modules of the grammar and across languages.",0
"The challenge the result interpretation of complex event nominalizations poses to a Distributed Morphology analysis was first laid out in detail in Borer 2003,  Ackema and Neeleman 2004, and Alexiadou (this volume) and  is taken up here.  This paper explores first what the internal structure of event nominalizations must consist of, by considering the syntax of verb-particle constructions and their behavior in mixed nominalizations (following the line of analysis laid out in Harley and Noyer 1998). Then an analysis of particular verbalizing morphemes (-ify, -ize, -en, and -ate) is proposed, identifying them as underspecified spell-outs of an eventive v° head. These two analyses jointly lead to particular conclusions about the internal structure of the VP, namely that it must include at least three projections: Voice, v, and √. Finally some speculation is presented about the problem of how to derive a result nominalization meaning from the event nominalization meaning, given the necessary conclusion, for DM, that even on the result interpreation, these nominals have verbal syntactic structure contained within them.",0
"The Person Case Constraint is frequently concomitant with Case Syncretism. We provide a

syntax-driven account of both phenomena that relies on the dual role that phi features play in selecting

and in Case licensing argument DPs. The account differs from other syntactic approaches

to the syntactic structures that feed morphology and therefore induce syncretism.

"In this paper I suggest a partly new way to look at morphological case. Inspired by HalldÃ¶r SigurÃ°sson  I see morphological case as a kind of morphological translation of syntactic structure into the language of PF. The main part of the paper is an attempt to account for nominative, accusative and dative in modern Icelandic in terms of Agree-relations between T/v and DPs.

   The syntactic account presented here is an implementation of recent ideas within the Minimalist program (Chomsky, Pesetsky & Torrego), according to which the syntactic derivation is driven by features with the help of the operation Agree. I use a very simple system of features, a tense feature Ï that is interpretable in T and v and uninterpretable in DPs, and Ï-features that are interpretable in DPs but uninterpretable in T and v. In addition, I assume UTAH (Baker 1997). Finally, in line with Hale & Keyser (2002) I assume that V always has a complement, sometimes visible but in other cases without phonological representation.",0
"In this paper, we suggest that the properties of Swedish present participles can be accounted for if we take a syntactic approach to lexical categories in the lines of Distributed Morphology. We depart from the fact that Swedish words ending in -ande/-ende have the same denotation whether they appear attributively, predicatively, or nominally. Syntactically however, -ande/-ende-derivations appear in a multitude of functions. This suggests that the underlying syntactic structure of what appears to be the same form may differ. We argue in terms of Distributed Morphology for two Swedish present participles, one nominal ending on -ande/-ende and one true adjective ending in -ande/-ende, where  ande/-ende for the present participle cases denote imperfectivity and are licensed by an Asp head. For true adjectives, -ande/-ende are reanalysed as adjectival morphemes that denote property and are licensed by a categorial head a.",0
"This paper explores the idea that abstract Agree is a precondition on Merge and an integrated part of it. That is, an element F merges with the structure X only if the relation of Agree holds between the two (the Agree Condition on Merge). The relation of Agree holds between F and X iff X contains an active feature fx that matches F. Move is forced by an inactive intervener x between F and fx, which, if not crossed by fx, would block matching, F ↔ fx. It follows that Move and Merge are fundamentally different, Move tucking in, as a rescuing operation in an already existing structure, whereas Merge adds information to structure, thereby expanding it.

Whenever Merge applies, the possibility of agreement arises, i.e. languages make parametric (PF) choices whether or not to signal each instance of Merge morphologically, that is, agreement is in effect a sign of compositionality. The various agreement phenomena of Icelandic illustrate that agreement involves feature copying processes that take place exclusively in PF. Thus, morphological agreement is quite distinct from (albeit preconditioned by) abstract syntactic Agree. In addition, the Icelandic facts discussed suggest that also head movement is confined to PF.

If this is on the right track, PF is a multilayered and a highly complex system, producing strings that can be radically different from underlying syntactic structures.",0
"This paper is concerned with theoretical and empirical issues in the

definition and treatment of morphological categories.  Considering the

decomposition of privative categories into bundles of binary features,

I discuss what work the latter should be expected to do.  I

propose a fairly literal interpretation of these component binary

features and argue that we should take their independence from one

another more seriously.  I then show that this provides us with

the means to deal nicely with default categories, in particular the

phenomenon known as default case.",0
"This paper examines the role that the traditional notion of finiteness has played in analyses of clause structure and argument licensing in the development the Minimalist Program. I focus on three broad domains: the upper, middle and lower areas of clause structure which roughly correspond to the A-bar, A, and theta-positions of Government and Binding theory, and their corresponding heads, C, T and V. Following the general format of this volume, the initial sections are intended as a (selective) reading of recent work on this topic, and I use and extend the conclusions from this in the final section. 

I argue that the 'semantics' of finiteness should be divorced from subject licensing, and show that tense and agreement features are independently responsible for subject licensing, and the effects of this can be seen when the C layer is removed, truncating the clause at TP.   I provide a particularly radical case of this kind of truncation in Gaelic, where the clause can be truncated at the VP level. In this case too, though, subjects can be licensed in a way that depends on the formal features T and Agr. This strongly argues for divorcing subject licensing from the interpretable feature [finite]. 



I argue, in line with expectations, that there is no clear mapping from the traditional notion of finiteness to the categories of formal grammar. There are phenomena, and there are attempted explanations of those phenomena which are embedded within a theoretical system. Typically the terms in which the explanation is couched will be far removed from the terms in which the original phenomenon was described, and I believe this is the case for finiteness.",0
"Expletive 'there' and its closest counterparts in other languages are not expletives in Chomskys sense (merged directly into a sentential Spec position). They are instead instances of deictic elements originating within their associate. In some languages, e.g. Paduan, these expletives can be imported into possessive sentences and (from there) into dative sentences, giving the impression in the latter case of syncretism between deictic clitic and dative clitic, but

the correct, more syntactic and less morphological, analysis is that in such languages the deictic clitic is not a dative clitic, though it cooccurs with a dative clitic that is silent.",0
"This paper examines the *you-us and *we-you agreement restriction (grouped

together here under the label g-/z- constraint here, due to its morphological

exponents), a Person-Case effect that is found throughout Bizkaian Basque.

We motivate the g-/z- constraint as a dissimilation rule involving adjacent

[+Participant] features, and consider the role of morphological markedness

as a trigger of postsyntactic feature deletion rules. The g-/z restriction shows

a great deal of microvariation in the repair it triggers; we examine six dialects.

Understanding these phenomena requires a distinction between two postsyntactic

and pre-spellout operations: impoverishment, which deletes the features

at a node (e.g. deletes [+Participant] on an ergative agreement morpheme),

and obliteration, which deletes an entire morpheme (e.g. deletes ergative

agreement), with concomitant effects on the allomorphy of other terminals.",0
"The cumulative philosophical, historical, social discrimination that the Indian Deaf community has passively resisted has resulted in the suppression of Indian Sign Language (henceforth, ISL), which has further violated their right to education through mother tongue, a violation of linguistic human rights. Consequently, linguistic violation has become a hindrance in empowering Deaf community in India. The proposed paper aims at highlighting the problems faced in the efforts towards a recognition of the linguistic human rights of the Indian Deaf people in empowering ISL and how linguistics can supplement in solving these issues. Finally, the paper calls to the linguist's community to address the contemporary problems regarding ISL by translating problems into prospects and in maintaining linguistic rights and ecology, to which scholarly analysts are accountable.",0
"The paper examines Basque dialects that differ in transparency of theta-related datives to clausal ""absolutive-type"" (v) phi-Agree, normally controlled by the structural absolutive (and ergative). Treating the dative as a PP, and thus a phase, explains its normal opacity to external Agree. A phi-probe on the P head of the shell that Agrees with its complement DP renders the latter's phi-features visible to the outside, selectively according to the feature-geometric articulation of the probe. A minimal version of such a probe results in ""quirky"" case, a theta-related case that is visible to phi-Agree only as 3rd person. The dialects where the dative controls clausal phi-Agree support the hypothesis that theme licensing in double object constructions in such languages involves a second number/gender probe on Appl.",0
"We discuss different theoretical approaches to stating blocking effects, with particular emphasis on cases in which words appear to block phrases (and perhaps vice versa). All of these approaches share at least one intuition, the idea that sets of syntactic and semantic features create a range of possible cells or slots in which particular items can appear, and that blocking occurs when one such cell is occupied by one form as opposed to another. Beyond these similarities, there are two primary dimensions along which accounts to blocking differ: (1) the size of the objects that compete with one another (morphemes, words, phrases, sentences); and (2) whether or not ungrammatical forms are taken into consideration in determining the correct output (relatedly, whether otherwise well-formed objects are marked ungrammatical by competition). We argue that blocking in the sense of a competition for the expression of syntactic or semantic features is limited to the insertion of the phonological exponents of such features (the Vocabulary Items of Distributed Morphology) at terminal nodes from the syntax. There is thus no blocking at the word level or above, and no competition between grammatical and ungrammatical structures. The architectural significance of these points is emphasized throughout the discussion.",1
"Since the 80s, the processing of non-phonological information in phonology has been dominated by two interface theories, Lexical Phonology and Prosodic Phonology. While the former is closely associated with stratal effects that rely on the existence of different classes of affixes, the latter translates phonologically relevant morpho-syntactic structure into a phonological arborescence that is known as the Prosodic Hierarchy.  The Prosodic Hierarchy to date stands unchallenged and is the theory-resident default when phonologists make reference to extra-phonological information. This has not changed in constraint-based environments which have taken over prosodic constituency with minor adaptations (e.g. Selkirk 2000, Kiparsky 2000, Bermúdez-Otero forth).

This article shows that the Prosodic Hierarchy is as much a diacritic as classical SPE-type boundaries (#, +), if an autosegmental one. Everybody today agrees that diacritics are non-linguistic objects and hence cannot be part of linguistic theory. This line of argumentation has contributed to outlaw # and the like; it is argued here that the Prosodic Hierarchy must be abandoned for the same reason.

A crucial advance made by Prosodic Phonology is the principle known as Indirect Reference according to which phonology cannot directly access morpho-syntactic structure and hence may not mention morpho-syntactic categories in the structural description of rules (or in constraints). The critical argument for Indirect Reference which is repeated over and over again in the literature is so-called non-isomorphism: the domain of the string which is phonologically relevant does not necessarily coincide with any morpho-syntactic constituent. Therefore, Prosodic Phonology argues, there must be a translating process whereby a Translator's Office  which is neither part of morpho-syntax nor of phonology  maps morpho-syntactic structure onto prosodic structure. While the Translator's Office takes morpho-syntactic structure as an input, it modifies it according to its own standards  thereby making it non-isomorphic  before handing it over to phonology in the coat of the Prosodic Hierarchy.

The article argues that Prosodic Phonology has reached exactly the right conclusion  but for the wrong reason: non-isomorphism is a mirage that is created by analysis, not by linguistic fact; it appears when one looks at the data through a prism that imposes domains, rather than boundaries. Non-isomorphism evaporates as soon as the same data are interpreted in terms of the latter. On the other hand, a good reason for the existence of the Translator's Office is modularity: different modules do not speak the same language (of the brain, e.g. Jackendoff 1992 et passim), and hence can only communicate through a no-man's land-based translation.

If the Prosodic Hierarchy thus is a domain-created mirage and boundaries turn out to be the correct interface currency, we seem to be requesting a self-contradicting theory, i.e. one where extra-phonological information is represented as non-diacritic boundaries. The article shows that this term does not need to be self-contradictory: its paradoxical flavour stems from the fact that the two essential properties of what is commonly called a ""boundary"" have never been distinguished. That is, boundaries are 1) local and 2) diacritic. The former seems to imply the latter  and this is exactly what is not true: there may well be non-diacritic boundaries. In other words, when boundaries were eliminated from phonological theory, the local baby was thrown out with the diacritic bath.

Hence the article proposes a theory where interface information is handed down locally  in the sense of what is traditionally called sandhi; yet the output of the Translator's Office are only truly phonological objects. A truly phonological object is one that exists in domestic phonology anyway and in absence of any interface-related issue. The result is Direct Interface, i.e. a theory where higher level information does not transit through a diacritic. A welcome effect of this is that different phonological theories, which of course have different domestic vocabulary, make different predictions as to what can be the output of the Translator's Office: only their domestic vocabulary is eligible as the output of the Translator's Office. Therefore, Direct Interface allows for evaluating phonological theories according to their behaviour at the interface  a new perspective.",0
"This article presents an event-related potentials (ERP) study of Hindi that investigates

whether electrophysiological responses to syntactic agreement violations vary as a

function of the type and number of incorrect agreement features. Hindi is well suited to

investigation of this issue, since verbs in Hindi mark agreement with the person, number,

and gender features of the subject noun phrase. Evoked responses were recorded for

visually presented verbs appearing at the end of a sentence-initial adverbial clause,

comparing responses in a grammatically correct condition with four grammatically

incorrect conditions that mismatched the correct agreement on different dimensions

(gender, number, gender+number, person+gender). A P600 response was elicited in all

grammatically incorrect conditions. No amplitude differences were found among the

gender, number, and gender+number conditions. This suggests that the degree of overlap

between observed and expected word forms at the morphosyntactic level does not impact

ERP responses, contrasting with findings at the semantic level (Federmeier & Kutas,

1999) and in auditory processing (Paavilainen et al., 2001). A significantly larger P600

response was elicited in the person+gender condition, an effect that is attributed to the

greater salience of the person feature in multiple levels of representation.",0
"This paper addresses the question of intrapersonal/intradialectal syntactic variation and argues that it is not (solely) a result of multiple spellouots of structures, but rather may arise because of the way that lexical items combine in the syntactic computation. The system predicts not just the possibility of variability, but also patterns of variability and categoricality, and furthermore, frequencies of variants in the output.",0
"Traditionally, three movement types have been recognized: A, A-bar, and head movement. Recent developments challenge this picture, however. In this paper I examine cases of roll-up movement, and suggest that some of the properties of this movement type can be understood in terms of cluster formation. I suggest that this partly clears up the relationship between morphology and syntax, and that some remnant movement might be understood in these terms as well.",0
"A key question to have emerged from the recent flurry of activity on number and related phi subsystems is whether such features are bivalent or privative.  The crucial difference is that bivalence permits a three-way contrast (0/[-F]/[+F]), whereas privativity, only a two-way one ([-F]/[+F] or 0/[F]).  The semantic basis and morphosyntactic reflexes of Kiowa-Tanoan noun classification are perspicuously captured in a system with three bivalent number features: [-/+singular], [-/+augmented], [-/+group].  Privative analyses of the same facts require, inter alia, features without semantic motivation, syntactic mechanisms that violate Inclusivity, and feature annotation reminiscent of bivalence.  The semantic atoms of number are, therefore, bivalent.",0
"This paper describes the distribution of accusative case and discusses the nature of the nominative / accusative distinction in the standard Germanic languages. In addition, it illustrates and discusses the well-known fact that inherent accusatives and certain other types of accusatives do not behave in accordance with Bruzios Generalization. In spite of these Non-Burzionian accusatives, there is a general dependency relation between the so-called structural cases, Nom and Acc, here referred to as the relational cases, such that relational Acc is licensed only in the precense of Nom (as has been argued by many). This relation is here referred to as the Sibling Correlation, SC. Contrary to common belief, however, SC is not a structural correlation, but a simple morphological one, such that Nom is the first, independent case, CASE1 (an only child or an older sibling, as it were), whereas Acc is the second, dependent case, CASE2, serving the sole purpose of being distinct from Nom  the Nom-Acc distinction, in turn, being a morphological inerpretation or translation of syntactic structure. It has been an unresolved (and largely a neglected) problem that the Germanic languages split with respect to case-marking of predicative DPs: nominative versus accusative (It is I/me, etc.). However, the morphological approach to the relational cases argued for in this paper offers a solution to this riddle: The predicative Acc languages have extended the domain of the Sibling Correlation, such that it does not apply to only arguments but to adjacent DPs in general. That is, the English type of predicative Acc is not default, nor is it caused by grammatical viruses, but a well-behaved subtype of relational Acc. The central conclusion of the paper is that we need to abandon the structural approach to the relational cases in favor of a more traditional morphological understanding. However, this is not a conservative but a radical move. It requires that we understand morphology (and PF in general) not as a direct reflection of syntax but as a translation of syntax into an understandable but foreign code or language, the language of morphology. Nom and Acc are not syntactic features but morphological translations of syntactic correlations. It is thus no wonder that they are uninterpretable to the semantic interface.",1
"The differences and similarities between Romance change-of-state prefixed verbs and Latin verbs with cognate prefixes are laid out. An account is offered in terms of a syntactic theory of argument structure and word formation, and the phenomenon is put in relation to the typological distinction between satellite-framed languages and verb-framed languages.",0
"DISTRIBUTED MORPHOLOGY (DM) (Halle and Marantz, 1993) is a research program in morphology which abandons the generative Lexicon (Marantz, 1997 and 2001), the traditional module of language where derivational morphology is argued to take place. Recent work argues that all generative processes, including derivational morphology, can be accomplished syntactically, the SINGLE ENGINE HYPOTHESIS (Marantz, 2001).

In Chapter 1, I introduce the most recent work within DM which adopts and adapts Chomskys DERIVATION BY PHASE HYPOTHESIS to lexical-category formation. I then reanalyze some important and well-known data of Aronoff (1976) in order to show that the single engine hypothesis is motivated and explanatory.

Chapter 2 focuses on verbs from a common root that alternate in transitivity and the role of this non-root morphology. I then propose an analysis of two types of common deverbal nominalizations in Japanese. I argue that, actually, only one of the two types is deverbal; the other type is root-derived. Those root-derived nominalizations that contain apparent verbal transitivity markers seem to raise a paradox for the single engine hypothesis. I resolve it by adopting a proposal of den Dikken (1995)s; such morphology in both verbs and nouns are AFFIXAL PARTICLES. 

Chapter 3 concentrates on lexical causatives in Japanese. There is a widely-held view among linguists (Harley, 1995, 1996, Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 1995, Pinker, 1989, among many), that a lexical causative cannot be derived from a verb which has an agentive subject. Using observations of Matsumoto (1996) and data from idioms in Japanese I argue that no such semantic criterion applies in Japanese. Given the proper pragmatic reading, all verbs, including those with agentive subjects can have a mono-clausal lexical causative partner. This seemingly unique characteristic of Japanese is argued to be directly related to the fact that apparent adicity markers in Japanese are affixal particles as argued in Chapter 2.

Chapter 4 concludes with a brief comparison of transitivity marking in Turkish and Korean with Japanese. I argue that the differences support the affixal particle analysis for Japanese. The analysis also raises the issue about the direction of grammaticalization of the morphology found in alternating verbs. With Roberts and Roussou (2003)s work on grammaticalizations as background, this issue is discussed.",0
"The aim of this article is to determine how the phonological properties of certain

prepositions are related to their syntactic behavior. In a case study of Berber prepositions (Taqbaylit of Chemini), we offer an account of the morpho-phonology of nominal states, the status of prepositions in the extended projection of the noun, and the external syntax of prepositional phrases. Building on Guerssel and Lowenstamm (1990), we argue that structured templates establish the link between phonological and syntactic representations, and that the presence vs. absence of a templatic position is the only syntactically significant phonological property of any given marker.",1
"Much work on nonconfigurationality has noted a number of correlations in the behavior of arguments and the  Pronominal Argument Hypothesis (hereafter PAH). In this paper I discuss some
implications for analyses of nonconfigurationality using data from the Australian language Bardi. I show that
despite some enticing correlations in many languages which appear to support the PAH, data from Bardi poses problems for such an analysis. I argue instead that many of these correlations arise not from properties of nonconfigurationality, but from pronominal semantics, and are thus not relevant to the PAH. If my analysis is correct, many of the properties of polysynthetic languages which have been argued to be analyzed within a
nonconfigurational framework would instead be due to other facts of the grammar.",0
"This paper provides a unified account of genitive-subject case licensing   in subordinate contexts of Altaic languages.  Genitive-subject clauses, previously analyzed as a manifestation of Genitive/Nominative subject conversion phenomenon in the syntactic literature, are analyzed as exceptionally case marked subjects of clauses that lack the nominative-case licensing feature, similar to the well studied accusative-subject clauses that lack tense. Genitive is licensed by the phi features of a nominal functional category external to the clause in Turkish, as suggested for other languages (Miyagawa 1993, Krause 2001, among others).  The difference between genitive and accusative case licensing is restricted to the nature of the functional category that licenses subject case, which is nominal in the former and verbal in the latter. The syntactic mechanism involved in case licensing is language and/or structure dependent. The major theoretical implications of the proposed analysis are the following: de-coupling of case-agreement and motivating covert movement as a syntactic process along with Agree and Move. Theoretically, phi features are accepted to be uninterpretable features on Tense head, which are involved in subject case licensing through motivating the movement of the subject DP to Spec TP. In previous literature on Turkish (Kornfilt 1984, 1987, 1988, 2002, 2003) and European Portuguese (Raposo 1987, 1989), agreement is accepted to be the licensing head or feature for genitive case on subjects in subordinate contexts and for nominative subjects in matrix clauses (Kornfilt 1987, 1989).  This research maintains the idea that agreement is involved in genitive subject case licensing but argues that clause external rather than clause internal agreement is the key to understanding the syntactic mechanism involved.",0
"Two lines of recent research are brought together to argue that the

defining characteristic of German inherent dative arguments is not

morphological but syntactic.  On the one hand, evidence is mounting

that dative objects with two-place verbs, as well as those with

three-place verbs, differ in their argument-structural status from

direct objects receiving structural accusative case.  On the other

hand, the GB idea that movement is case-driven, which was central to

previous analyses of the behavior of inherent datives under

passivization, has been considerably weakened.  It is proposed instead

that the special syntactic, semantic and morphological properties of

dative arguments should be derived from the way in which they are

introduced into the structure.  This not only accounts for the German

data that form the basis of the discussion, but can also be more

easily extended to languages like Icelandic, which are famously

problematic for the original inherent Case analysis.",0
"This work is about compounding and compounds in Modern Greek and its purpose
is twofold: on the one hand to expose all possible constructs that can be qualified as compounds in the language and on the other hand to shed light onto the question concerning the manner in which they are formed. Although we make reference to several theories and models of word formation, our starting point is Lexicalism.
However, the ""traditional"" Lexicalist views are being checked against more radical theories. The organization of the work goes as follows: In Part1 we give an overview of major theoretical developments concerning Morphology in the Generative paradigm. Part 2 includes concrete examples of compounds and some ""traditional"" classificatory attempts. Part 3 deals with all possible relations the parts of a compound can have each one with another. Extra gravity is given to the distinction between synthetic and root compounds and to problems that traditional approaches face in their analysis. In part 4 we deal with the question of how lexical items are put together in order to form a compound. In part 5, we examine a hypothesis according to which certain complex words in Greek should be described syntactically along the lines of the transformational rule known as Head-to-Head movement. Finally, in part 6 we claim that certain inconsistencies and asymmetries shown in the system of compounds can be explained via a theory according to which Syntax and Morphology compete
for the generation of complex heads. It is also shown that unpredictable oncompositional semantics and derivational affixes trigger compound generation.",0
"Many languages have a suppletive instead of a regular derivational form for the ordinal FIRST (cf. Hurford 1987, Veselinova 1998). This paper argues on the basis of Dutch that this obligatory suppletion is due to the feature composition of cardinal numeral ONE which sets ONE apart from the other cardinal numerals and makes it incompatible with the  ordinal suffix -TH. On the basis of a detailed comparison of the morphosyntactic properties of ONE, MANY and the plural cardinals a novel  feature system for numerals is proposed that captures the similarities between ONE and MANY on the one hand and the plural cardinals on the other, as well as the differences between ONE and MANY.",0
"This thesis will address the implications of lexical cognates and regular sound correspondences in the basic vocabulary of Akan (Twi) and Yoruba.  Reconstruction, a central focus of comparative linguistics, is based upon determining regular sound correspondences between two languages that are already presumed to be related. By applying the comparative method and implicational laws of sound change to data derived from the first and second Swadesh Lists, the phonological inventory of the proto-language, Proto-Benue-Kwa (East Volta-Congo), from which Akan (Twi) and Yoruba are descended, will be juxtaposed with current reconstructions, primarily as pertaining to the initial consonant (C1). These recurrent phonological correspondences will serve to bring us closer to a true reconstruction of Proto-Benue-Kwa (East Volta-Congo) in essentially the same way as ""Proto-Germanic-Latin-Greek-Sanskrit"" served the pioneers of linguistic reconstruction as a pilot Proto-Indo-European. This thesis will add to the discourse of comparative and historical linguistics in the African milieu by testing current reconstructions and engaging current methodological and theoretical debates in African linguistics. This thesis culminates in the establishment of the Proto-Benue-Kwa Push Chain and the establishment of a clear phonetic environment for Proto-Benue-Kwa labial-velars vis-à-vis the labialized velars. The primary contribution to knowledge is in a refinement of current proposals of the phonological inventory as pertains to the C1 of the common pre-dialectal mother tongue (Proto-Benue-Kwa) from which both Akan (Twi) and Yoruba are descended based on analyzed data.",0

"The placement of second position clitics has been analysed as involving syntactic movement,

allomorphy and phonological phrasing preclude a prosodic inversion analysis. I show

how application of a morphological transposition operation (the Morphological Merger

of Marantz 1988) not only to overt clitics in the language, but also to the functional

head Force, provides a unified analysis of this highly intricate system.",0
"Data that could adjudicate between theories of multiple reduplication are relatively hard to come by. The languages of the Pacifc Northwest provide a fertile ground for testing and development of such theories. I examine patterns from Lushootseed (Salish) and Nitinaht (Wakashan), as well as typologically and geographically distant languages like Thao and Manam

(Austronesian) and develop a theory where reduplicated forms are the result of linearization of non-linear phonological forms (Raimy 2000). I argue that non-linearity can appear in lexical representations as well as in poly-morphemic forms and that linearization applies at several points in a derivation, rather

than solely at the interface with phonetics. The latter point challenges Urbanczyk's (2001) monostratal Optimality Theoretic analysis of Lushootseed and suggests that several strata of linearity and non-linearity intervene between lexical and surface phonological forms.",0
"Agreement under left to right Merge in essence yields the Spec head hypothesis for agreement. This paper defends that this is the only configuration that yields agreement, and evaluates some of the evidence from long distance agreement for Agree. It is argued that: Spec head agreement also covers concord (on the basis of the DP in Maasai); that agreement can be triggered under pied-piping(Tsez),and that English long distance agreement must be a case of agreement low in the structure. A case study on Icelandic nominative objects shows agreement reflects movement, that the source of nominative is low in the structure. Intervention effects only occur over a clausal boundary, and are absent in simpler syntactic configurations, contrary to the expectations under Agree. It is suggested that intervention effects do not bear on Agree, but on restructuring.",1

"This paper derives instances of (intra-paradigmatic and trans-paradigmatic) syncretism in Russian noun inflection in a systematic way, by decomposing both case features (as is standard in the Jakobsonian tradition) and inflection class features. The analysis reveals iconicity: The form of an inflection marker (more precisely, the vocabulary item's position on the sonority hierarchy) correlates with its function (i.e., the vocabulary item's degree of specificity). In addition, a feature-changing impoverishment rule is adopted to capture the animacy effect in the masculine declension and in the plural.",0
"This paper provides a Distributed Morphology (DM) approach to the thematic licensing of verbs and extends that approach to the licensing of strong verb alternations such as eat/ate.  These verbal behaviors have been captured in the DM literature by limiting the morphological environments that condition the insertion of Vocabulary Items (c.f. secondary exponence).  In this paper, I show that the verbs in question gain the features of the environment they appear in by undergoing fusion with the relevant heads.  In this way, DM does not need to rely upon conditioning the insertion of irregular verbs, but need only rely upon the Subset Principle to license the insertion of these verbs.",1
"Breton phi-agreement is characterized by the Complementarity Effect, which allows pro-dropped but not lexical DPs to control phi-agreement. We contrast verbal and prepositional systems: a lexical DP co-occurs with the root form of a preposition, but with a 3rd.sg. (frozen agreement) form of a verb. We argue that frozen agreement arises through phi-relativized locality: the Breton vP independently shows nominal properties, and thus intervenes for agreement. The phi-probe of T Agrees with the vP for 3rd.sg. rather than the vP-internal subject. In the prepositional system on the other hand, lexical DPs occur with bare stems and phi-inflection spells out affixed pronouns. The mechanics predict that in verbal constructions where the subject originates outside the vP, it is local enough to control the agreement of T, which correctly yields Have under a prepositional analysis as the sole verb immune to the Complementarity Principle. Finally, we propose a typology of complementarity effects in agreement depending on the interaction of intervention (frozen agreement) and syntactic incorporation past the intervener.",0
"This paper lays out a pragmatist view of field research that predates my Current Anthropology paper (2005) on Piraha culture and grammar, laying a partial  philosophical and practical basis for that type of research.

"It is shown that the connection posited by Roberts (1997) between the loss of case marking and the shift from OV to VO in English is contradicted by the facts of English and the other Germanic languages.  It is argued that this failure is not the result of an incorrect handling of the syntactic or morphological details, but of the way that the proposal straddles the syntax-morphology interface.  Parallels are explored with research on verb-raising and agreement, and it is proposed that, in order to be more than a descriptive generalization, the claim that some morphological property has a syntactic effect must be couched in terms that both the morphology and the syntax can refer to in a principled way.",0
"This paper discusses the very general question of how syntactic features of individual languages relate to the universal set of syntactic features. It is pointed out that Chomskys approach (2001) to this fundamental issue is paradoxical. On one hand he argues that language is uniform in the relevant sense (L-UNIFORMITY), but, on the other hand, he also assumes that languages make different selections of features from a universal feature set (L-SELECTION). The paper argues strongly that L-uniformity is the only conceivable possibility. However, if that is correct, a great deal of what languages have is common is silence, that is, categories that are present in Narrow Syntax but silent in PF. In other words, language has innate elements and structures irrespective of whether or how they are overtly expressed. It follows that language variation is to a substantial extent silence variation, that is, much of it boils down to languages being explicit vs. silent about different (syntactically active) categories. This claim is coined as the SILENCE PRINCIPLE, saying that any meaningful feature of language may be silent.",0
"This paper discusses overtly marked counterfactual constructions in English and Turkish to provide a uniform syntactic account of counterfactual structures cross-linguistically. The grammatical ingredients of counterfactuals (Cf) in Turkish are investigated as a means to illustrate two claims:
  
(i)	Counterfactual interpretation involves the C(omplementizer) domain cross-linguistically;
(ii)	Iatridou's (2000) generalizations based on Indo-European languages hold for Turkic languages (Turkish, Tuvan, Kazakh, and Gagauz): ""tense"" morphology is interpreted as a counterfactual morpheme when it ranges over worlds within the semantic domain of conditionals.
 
The counter-factuality is overtly marked by a shift in the order of morphemes in Turkic languages, whereas it is overt only in Inverted Conditionals in English. In Turkish, this operation is morpho-syntactic, in English it is syntactic.

"The paper argues that Person interprets event participants in relation to speech participants in a parallel fashion as grammatical Tense interprets event time in relation to speech time. This understanding of Person is embedded in a general theory of speech-grammar-event matching, that is to say, an approach where speech (event) features, SF, are matched by grammatical features, GF, which in turn are matched by (propositional) event features, EF.",0
"This paper advances the case that linguistics requires a unified theory of number, serviceable to both semantics and morphology, by proving that the morphological concept of augmentation and the semantic concept of cumulation are near logical equivalents.  From this emerge an inventory of number features incorporating the categories `paucal' and `unit augmented', a typology of number systems crosslinguistically, and indication of other areas of likely convergence between semantic and morphological research.",0

"This paper discusses the formation of suppletive versus non-suppletive verbal stems in Modern Greek within Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993). I argue that the formation of non-suppletive stems occurs at the morphological component, whereas the formation of suppletive ones in the vocabulary via morpholexical rules. From a theoretical point of view, I propose that the phonological forms of the vocabulary items - corresponding to suppletive stems - stored in the vocabulary are altered by rules which involve reference to morphological and syntactic features. The application of such rules in the vocabulary also proves that its nature is not restricted to a repository of the mapping between morphophonological and morphosyntactic features but it is now extended to an active subcomponent participating in word formation. Consequently word formation is seen as a process requiring the obligatory interaction of syntax morphology-phonology and the rules applied in the vocabulary.",1
"This paper builds a theory in which Raimy's (2000a) notion of non-linear phonological precedence is exploited to produce a typology of possible affix types. I investigate the range of logically possible non-linear precedence structures and show how it closely mirrors observed morphological phenomena in

the world's languages. The result is that disparate types of morphology can be unified under a single formal mechanism, rather than distributing them across methods of concatenation, prosodic circumscription, and copying/repetition. As a way to constrain this system, I argue for a merger of Yu's (2003) work on infixation and phonological landmarks with Raimy's system of non-linear precedence. I show empirically that a somewhat powerful and idiosyncratic approach to morpho-phonological ordering is necessary and that a combination of non-linearity and anchor points provides some of the power that is needed

in the modelling of human language affixation. I then discuss some ways in which the resulting system may be both too weak and too powerful.",0
"We propose that agreement displacement phenomena sensitive to person hierarchies arise from the mechanics of Agree operating on articulated phi-feature structures in a cyclic syntax.  Cyclicity and locality derive preference for agreement control by the internal argument.  Articulation of the probe derives when the agreement control cyclically displaces to the external argument, and differences in cross-linguistic sensitivity to person hierarchies.  The system characterizes two classes of derivations corresponding to direct and inverse contexts empirically, and predicts the existence and nature of repair strategies in inverse contexts.  The properties of agreement displacement thus reduce to properties of syntactic dependency formation, Agree.",0
"This paper examines some features of the complex predicate formations found in many Turkic languages, including Turkish, Tuvan, and Uzbek. The construction which I will examine comprises a verb with the converb marker  (i)b or  (i)p and one of a limited set of inflecting verbs. I will contrast -IB gerunds in complex predicates with their use in other non-finite constructions. There is a high degree of similarity between light verb constructions in a language like Urdu (Butt and Geuder 1999) and the -IB + inflecting verb structures found in Turkic, and I wish to suggest that the same phenomena are occurring in both groups of languages.",0

"In this thesis, I examine the nominal morphology of Proto-Indo-European, Attic Greek, and Hittite in the theoretical framework of Distributed Morphology (DM), a recent theory which departs from traditional conceptions of morphology in a number of ways. In the first three chapters, we will address these three languages one at a time, showing that DM gives us new insight into the synchronic system of these languages and certain dialectal and diachronic shifts within them. I show that DM provides a simple account of the morphological systems we encounter and their interrelationship. In particular, the close relationship between these languages is reflected in their synchronic systems, but they diverge in important respects as well, and I attempt to account for these facts and how they relate to the theory. Certain theoretical issues which bear on the analysis are investigated as well, in particular the scope of impoverishment and the place of extrinsic ordering in morphology. In chapter 4, we take a closer look at the predictions of DM for morphological change and possible descriptions of diachrony from within the theory, taking examples from the internal histories described in chapters 1-3 as well as the development of Greek and Hittite from Proto-Indo-European. In particular, DM accounts for case syncretism with the devices of impoverishment and underspecification, each of which makes certain predictions about diachronic stability of morphological systems and the kinds of change which should occur. I show that these predictions are borne out to a large degree. Finally, I give a quick overview of a few interactions between the formal system and the 5 functional motivations for linguistic change which have been implicit in the preceding chapters.",0
"In this paper I address questions concerning the relationship between morphological/ syntactic form and phonological behavior as they arise in an examination of the 'mobile' or 'floating' inflections of Polish.

"In this paper I analyze the morphosyntactic alternations involving the causative morpheme l- in Hupa, an Athapaskan language. The distribution of this morpheme is of interest because it is intermediate between that of what might be called a 'lexical' causative, and that of a syntactic causative which takes a clausal complement. I will argue that a uniform treatment may be given for l- in structural terms; that is, that its distribution is determined by syntactic considerations, such that it always appears as a causative (light) verbal head with the same type of complement. The analysis I propose provides an identical syntactic treatment for two sets of environments, one of which exhibits idiosyncrasies associated with Lexical processes, and one of which does not; this raises questions concerning the applicability of a syntactic account for all of the cases in question. I thus devote the concluding sections of the paper to a discussion of the resolution to this question, and its implications for the relationship between syntax and argument structure. In addition, I discuss the implications of the discussion for analyses of the Transitivity Alternation, focussing on questions surrounding the morphology found in intransitive/transitive pairs.",0

"Celtic and Semitic languages show the following clustering of typological properties: 
(i) the Complementarity Principle in the verbal agreement system;

The aim of this paper is to show how (i-iii) are derived in one of these languages taken as a case study.

"Present transformational generative grammar of a Chomskyan type concentrates on formal properties and characteristics of passive structures which have not yet been in the centre of attention of Czech linguistics. In this paper we discuss the formal properties of the Czech analytic passive structures using the contemporary stage of development of the Chomskyan framework. That is, different types of syntactic passives are generated differently by exploiting the different possibilities of derivation by phase. Our analysis of passives is thus also meant to show that even languages with rich inflection and relatively free constituent order, like Czech, can successfully be described in terms of generative grammar, and that such an analysis is not merely an application of it, but can contribute to the development of the general linguistic theory as well.",0
"On the basis of observations regarding the possible interpretations of phi-feature mismatch under VP-ellipsis we argue that the notion of feature valuation, which plays a central role in current minimalist work, may be a reflex of a PF requirement rather than an LF one. We show that, in certain elliptical contexts, LF tolerates pronouns which cannot have been valued for certain features. A natural conclusion to draw is that this is driven by morphology: one might think that a feature will need valuing just where a value is required in order to determine PF form, and hence that if, for example, no number distinction is formally made, then no number feature needs to be valued. In fact, we will see that the reality is more complex than this, although morphology does play a role. We show that the morphological manifestation of a feature which can in some contexts have real content (such as a value of a phi-feature) does not necessarily have real content in all occurrences. Conversely, a morphologically visible feature whose value is formal in some contexts does not have only a formal value in all occurrences. A further consequence of our observations is that bound variable pronouns and referential pronouns are distinct kinds of syntactic object.",0

"In this study, adjunct/complement and subject/object asymmetry in Turkish scrambling is discussed. A uniform account of Turkish facts are given within an approach unifying the claims in Miyagawa (1999) and Pesetsky and Torrego (2000). The presence/absence of subject/object asymmetry in subordinate clauses in Turkish (non-finite, finite and finite ECM) are accounted by feature driven phrasal movement, T-to-C, and DPs whose case feature are deleted by the end of the phase and are thus inactive for external syntactic operations. It is shown that when there is more than one element bearing the same feature and competing for the same landing site, the movement of the non-local one is blocked.",0
"This paper was written several years ago. It was published ultimately as a paper in IJAL (the pronoun portion) and the syntax part in a volume edited by Robert Van Valin.

This paper proposes a new kind of morphosyntactic entity, LIMINAL CATEGORIES (LCs), which shares properties of words and phrases simultaneously. It proposes an analysis of three kinds of LCs in the Amazonian language, Wari', (i) periphrastic pronouns; (ii) complex kinship terms; and (iii) and INTENTIONAL STATE CONSTRUCTIONS (ISCs). I propose an account of LCs in Role and Reference Grammar (RRG) and conlude that LCs are not abnormalities, but fundamental components of the syntax of human languages. I argue that though some current theories can account for Wari' complex kinship terms and periphrastic pronouns, RRG is better equipped to analyze the predicates of ISCs, as part of its general account of LCs.",0
"English shm-reduplication, as in Oedipus shmoedipus, is well known but  incompletely understood. McCarthy and Prince (1986:71) for instance state that  the initial consonants, if any, are replaced by a specified consonant or cluster  [in this case Sm-]. Sanders 2000 similarly states a word is fully reduplicated, and  the initial onset of the reduplicant is replaced with schm-. Such analyses leave  many subcases of shm-reduplication unexplained; what about cases where shm-  does not replace the entire onset, as in breakfast-shmreakfast (in the film Mall  Rats)? What about obscene, obschmene, where shm- overwrites a medial onset?  What about árcade, shmárcade, where the stress of the base word changes?  



  Despite frequent references in the literature (e.g. Feinsilver 1961, McCarthy and  Prince 1986, Zwicky and Pullum 1987, Pullum 1991, Alderete et al. 1996,  Ginzburg and Sag 2000), English shm-reduplication and its attendant problems  have yet to receive a thorough or satisfactory linguistic study. To address these  lacunae we conducted a detailed online survey.  Based on the principled variation  that emerged, we characterize a restricted set of morphophonological operations  with implications for both rules and representations as they may variably target  prosodic landmarks (first vs. stressed syllable), syllabic landmarks (onset vs. first  consonant) and the phrasal size of the target of reduplicative morphemes (first  word vs. entire phrase). Second, based on subjects treatment of s-, m-, schm-, and  sh-initial words, and words whose output is an existing schm- initial word (e.g.  Joe schmo), we argue that avoidance phenomena show a regularity that, contra  Pullum 1991 and Sanders 2000, cannot be dismissed as metalinguistic.",0
"This thesis explores the formal mechanisms by which agreement relations are derived in syntax. The empirical focus is on some difficult cases of verb-NP agreement (Georgian, Algonquian and others) which present serious locality paradoxes when analyzed using standard mechanisms of syntactic agreement. The agreement systems in question have typically been taken to be symptomatic of a fundamental mismatch between syntax and morphology, however I treat them as evidence for a relativized formulation of conditions on Agree, under which they are in fact systematically isomorphic with well-defined derivational syntactic sequences. The claim is thus that surface complexity in these paradigms is best described in terms that are characteristically syntactic: long-distance dependencies, downwards locality/minimality, intervention effects and cyclicity (defined over syntactic operations). The analysis relies crucially on a fine-grained approach to formal phi (?), where ? encode the grammatical properties of nominals that typically enter into agreement: person, number, gender. Three aspects of ? feature theory are developed: (A) the representation of implicational relations between ? features; (B) feature-theoretic formulations of the syntactic operations that enter into the establishment of ? agreement relations; (C) the notion of ? feature (de)activation, and its interaction with syntactic projection, and cyclicity. The theory of agreement that emerges allows for a unification of complex agreement systems  a diverse and robust group  with their simpler, more familiar counterparts.",0
The empirical and theoretical arguments for the theory of allomorphy advocated by Carstairs-McCarthy are inadequate to motivate more than^M a minor modification to Bobaljik's model of grammatically conditioned allomorphy directionally constrained by root-out cyclic vocabulary insertion.,0
"Irish inflecting prepositions involve an abstract Agreement morpheme added after syntax. This is spelled out by pronominal endings for all forms except the least marked 3sg.m., which is instead a monomorphemic stem alternant. The opposition between the two types of forms is supported by the special status of the 3sg.m form in the paradigm. Stem alternants that realize this feature combination don't actually spell out any pronominal feature, but just the abstract Agreement morpheme. The fact that this morpheme is added after syntax explains why there is no real agreement in syntactic sense. The difference between the '3sg.m' form and the base form is that^M the former spells out P plus abstract Agreement, while the latter spells out P in the context of Agreement but without discharging it. This permits a simple analysis of a puzzling allomorphy pattern (some P must appear as 3sg.m before a def. article) as postsyntactic insertion of abstract Agr, a type of epenthesis that has many parallels in Irish.",0

"In Veselovská (1995, Section 5.5) I discuss possible examples of N-to-D Movement in Czech. I demonstrate that there is no reason to assume any such movement with Czech nouns, either common or proper. The only plausible candidates are some few pronouns which I briefly exemplify in Section 1. In the following parts I discuss Czech indefinite, negative, free choice and interrogative pronouns and show that their [+/-HUMAN] forms exemplify two distinct structures represented by distinct morphological patterns. 
As for my methodology, this paper argues in favour of a model of grammar which takes inflectional morphology for a signal of relevant syntactic relations. I demonstrate that applying the cyclic approach and several theoretical assumptions, the generative syntactic framework can explain even very complex morphological patterns which systematically correlate with distinct syntactic behaviour and interpretations.",0
"Polarity items must, by definition, lie inside the scope of their licenser; items like any N, in addition, appear to require a c-commanding and overt licenser. It is argued that the relevant restriction refers to precedence, not c-command, and that it is morphological, not syntactic. This implies a morphological dimension of dependence, in addition to the semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic ones. This analysis relies on the separation between syntax and a postsyntactic morphological component: the exponents of the relevant polarity items require an [operator] feature that never appears in the corresponding feature bundle at the output of syntax. This mismatch is resolved by copying the feature from the licensing operator, provided it is present at morphological structure (overt) and linearly preceding.",0
"The purpose of this article is to provide an explanatory account of the divide between enclisis and proclisis in pronominal clitic constructions in Romance and Semitic languages. The analysis is based on two fundamental assumptions: (i) clitics do not target pre-labelled positions, but take maximal advantage of the available categorial structure; (ii) cliticization patterns are tightly dependent on the inflectional properties on the language, more specifically, on the feature content of the two functional categories, INFL and v. We show that the various asymmetries in clitic behaviour can elegantly be explained in terms of the minimalist theory of movement, combined with certain formal hypotheses about the building of phrase structure and about the relation of morphology to syntax. Relying on recent ideas about uninterpretable features, Attract and Agree, we argue that cliticization patterns can be made to follow from the strategies made available by U.G. to check the uninterpretable feature of the category INFL and from the derivational origin of the tense and person-number features. A principle, the Unselective Attract Principle, is introduced according to which an uninterpretable feature is a potential attractor for all the features which are of the same type as the one which it selectively attracts. In Romance and in Semitic, clitic phi-sets are unselectively attracted by INFL. Two additional principles, the Priority Principle and the Single Licensing Condition, insure that at some point in the derivation, a clitic can incorporate into Infl only if Infl doesn't already host an attracted inflectional morpheme. This idea holds the key for the enclisis/proclisis divide. Enclisis, i.e. clitic incorporation into Infl, is disallowed in Romance finite clauses where the uninterpretable feature of Infl selectively attracts the person-number agreement phi-set; it is legitimate in Semitic and European Portuguese finite clauses in which the same feature is checked through Agree.",0
"This paper argues for a distinction between word formation from roots and word formation from existing words. Focusing on Hebrew, it is shown that words made of roots may be assigned multiple and varied interpretations, while words made of existing words must depend semantically and phonologically on the word from which they are derived. To account for this difference, a locality constraint on the interpretation of roots is postulated: the first nominal or verbal head that merges with the root serves as the immediate environment for determining its interpretation. This head forms a closed domain: any further derivation takes as its input not the root itself, but an element whose semantic (and phonological) properties have been cashed out. Word-derived words thus have access only to the words they are derived from, not to the root itself. While the ability of Hebrew roots to acquire multiple interpretations is language specific, the distinction between word formation from roots and word formation from words is shown to be universal, following from the locality restriction on the interpretation of the root.",1
"Linguists have long posited  abnormal  (i.e.,  nongenetic ) transmission in Creole genesis, supposedly with  significant discrepancies , in opposition to  normal  (i.e.,  genetic ) transmission in  regular  language change, whereby a language is  passed down from one speaker generation to the next with changes spread more or less evenly across all parts of the language  (see, e.g., Thomason and Kaufman 1988). This is what I call  Creole Exceptionalism . In this paper, I select various patterns in morphology and word order in order to question Creole Exceptionalism. Take  discrepancies in one core domain of Creole genesis, namely VP-related morphosyntax. Are such discrepancies at all  exceptional ? I start with a sample of VP-related properties in Haitian Creole (HC) a bona  de Creole on sociohistorical grounds. I compare the morphosyntax of verbs and object pronouns in HC and in some of its major source languages. I also speculate on the development of said morphosyntax from the perspective of second- and first-language acquisition and the role of grammaticalization and reanalysis therein. This, in turn, leads me to examine various theoretical proposals on the morphology-syntax interface vis-a-vis verb and object placement in language change/creation, and to consider germane patterns in Germanic and French diachrony. I also compare the HC patterns with their counterparts from a couple of other Romance-lexifier Creoles, namely Cape Verdean Creole (lexifier: Portuguese) and Palenquero Creole (lexifier: Spanish). My conclusions are fourfold: (i) Even within a small sample of Romance-lexifier Creoles, there is no structural  Creole uniformity in the VP and its extended projections. (ii) Certain  discrepancies  in French and English diachrony seem as significant as their analogues in Creole diachrony. (iii) This paper's observations argue against the classic (e.g., Bickertonian) Pidgin-to-Creole scenarios whereby pidginization qua structural  break in transmission produces a macaronic and a xless pidgin that subsequently seeds a Creole qua ab novo creation. (iv) Similarly, there is little evidence from HC to support Lefebvre's relexification hypothesis whereby HC grammar would essentially reflect substratum grammar with the French contribution strictly limited to phonetic strings  deprived of [syntactic and semantic] features  and to word-order patterns in lexical projections only (Lefebvre 1998). The overall conclusion is that Creole languages do not constitute a well-delineated and exceptional class (i.e., there are no special diachronic processes of  creolization  and there is no distinct and uniform  Creole  typology):  creolization  and  language change  reflect processes of language development that are uniform across the species.",1
"We formally and empirically examine the phonological relation immediate precedence, its properties, and further relations that can be derived from it. When each occurrence of a phonological segment in a non-linear multiprecedence structure is reconcatenated into a linear sequence of copies, reduplication results (Raimy 2000a). A number of consequences arise in the representation of affixes, in modelling allomorphy in Hindi and Turkish echo reduplication, and in explaining patterns of multiple reduplication in Lushootseed (Salish). We offer directions for further analysis of reduplication that distinguish conditions on multiprecedence from other wellformedness modules without ""the emergence of the unmarked"" as a central tenet.",0
"This study proposes an Optimality-theoretic model through which the various grammar components--semantics, syntax, the lexicon, morphology, and prosody--jointly determine the placement of clitics with a phrasal positioning domain, which is either a nominal expression or a clause. In order to render scope, such clitics must be phrase-initial. However, the morphology, carrying out subcategorization encoded in the lexicon, requires many such clitics to be suffixes. A third constraint prohibits affixation across certain syntactic boundaries. These three constraints require conflicting outputs, and cannot all be satisfied simultaneously. Depending on a particular language's constraint hierarchy, at least one constraint must be violated. Thus, a typology of clitic-placement strategies is predicted. This theory of cross-linguistic variation is based on conflicting requirements imposed by the aforementioned components of the grammar. In addition to an overview of clitic phenomena in Slavic and elsewhere, this paper demonstrates the proposed typology primarily using a clitic phenomenon in Russian in comparison to those in Tagalog and Warlpiri. In addition, these proposals make specific predictions about which kinds of clitic positioning can and cannot occur. Namely, these constraints predict an asymmetry in clitic-positioning types, excluding penultimate clisis.",0

"In Noyer (1993) and Trommer (2001b) models for OT-morphology are proposed, where morphology interprets the output of Syntax along the lines of Distributed Morphology (DM, Halle and Marantz, 1993). A major virtue of such a modular architecture is its restrictiveness: Syntactic representations and constraints cannot directly interact with morphological constraints. In contrast, Bresnan (1999b) argues that syntactic constraints do directly interact with morphological constraints, and that there is only one morphosyntactic evaluation procedure. In this paper I develop a modular model of morphosyntax based on Trommer (2001b) and show that the data that Bresnan and others have provided in favor of a global model of OT-morphosyntax can be easily reinterpreted in this model.",0
"When inflectional allomorphy is grammatically conditioned, are there any constraints on the direction of conditioning (inward or outward)?  Claims made by Bobaljik (2000) and Carstairs (1987) are compared with respect to data from Hungarian, Itelmen and Latin.  An answer is suggested that exploits the notion of direct ancestry (relationships between (grand) mothers and (grand-)daughters) in word-structure trees, and the notion of blur avoidance in paradigmatic structure (Carstairs-McCarthy 1994).  Implications for Stump<92>s (2001) theory of paradigm structure are briefly discussed.",0
"This paper examines and evaluates what may be called the ""Rich Agreement Hypothesis"" (RAH) in the domain of verb movement asymmetries in Germanic. The most prominent current accounts (e.g., Rohrbacher's 1999 Morphology-Driven Syntax) require inspection of the internal make-up of paradigms and take overt morphological variation to be the cause of syntactic variation. A survey of the literature shows that these proposals are empirically untenable in their strong (bi-conditional) form; there are numerous cases of syntactic variation attested in the absence of corresponding morphological variation. The strongest sustainable descriptive generalization is a one-way implication from rich morphology to verb movement. Though this has been noted before, it's implications have not been adequately discussed. While lexicalist approaches could have explained a strong RAH; when faced with the weaker, one-way implication they can provide no account of why that correlation should hold, and are thus at best incomplete. That is, they provide no insight as to why there are no languages with rich morphology, but in which the finite verb remains in the VP. The particular correlations that are attested, and in particular the absence of a certain class of languages, do however follow from a theory which takes morphology to be not the cause, but rather a reflection, of syntactic structure, in line with common theorizing in morphology. The inflection-movement correlations that do exist therefore challenge rather than supporting morphology-driven approaches to morphosyntax.",0
This paper (2000) explores the phenomenon of anti-agreement in the Bantu language of Kinande and argues that the anti-agreement effect arises because the subject occupies a high position in the left periphery. Extraction would necessarily target a lower focus position. This downward movement is prevented by the requirement that movement must successive cyclically expand the tree.,0
"In this paper, I adopt Hagstrom (1998) to account for Turkish facts. Turkish is a wh-in-situ language where the Q-particle does not appear in wh-questions except for echo questions.

The distribution of the Q-Particle will be given in (I); the problem of analyzing embedded questions in Turkish will be presented in (II); similarities in the function of  Japanese and Turkish Q-Particle and wh-words, and differences in Turkish and Japanese &Sinhala Q-Movement will be discussed in (III); evidence on Q-movement in Turkish based on intervention effects and availability of P(air) L(ist) Reading will be given in (IV); an observation on the dual position of the particle in Turkish which may shed light into the nature of  Q-movement will be presented in (V); and the significance of study on echo questions in research on questions will be briefly discussed in (VI).

"We will devote our commentary to two topics from Ullman et al.'s study: (1) the linguistic assumptions that underlie the Ullman et al. investigation, and (2) the implications of the study for linguistic theory. The paper is a detailed study of the English past tense in aphasia, and is couched in the context of the larger debate between connectionist and non-connectionist models of human linguistic competence. From the perspective of linguistic theory, the attention devoted to arguing against connectionist models is regrettable, however necessary it may be in the larger context of cognitive neuroscience. Research in connectionist frameworks in the past has revealed nothing new about the nature of the human language faculty, and the current research program is based more on vague and unsatisfying promissory notes than on results that have consequences for our understanding of language (McClelland and Seidenberg (2000)). The results of the Ullman et al. study indicate yet again that there are fundamental problems with the connectionist research program, about which we have nothing further to say",0
"It has long been observed that both the meaning and the form of a verb play a role in determining the syntactic configurations in which this verb is found. For example, give, but not donate or wash, is used in the double-object construction: I gave/*donated/*washed Mary a car. The contrast has been attributed in part to morphophonological properties, like the Latinate form of donate, and in part to semantic properties, like the fact that wash does not imply a transfer of possession (Oehrle 1976). In this paper, I propose that another constraint on verb distribution, the Target/Subject Matter (T/SM) restriction (Pesetsky 1995), also arises from a combination of morphological and semantic factors. I argue that semantic selectional restrictions rule out certain derivations that would give rise to a T/SM violation, while morphological selectional restrictions guide the pronunciation of the well-formed derivations. This conclusion supports the position of Distributed Morphology that semantic, but not morphological information is available during the syntactic derivation (Halle & Marantz 1993).",0
"We develop a theory of movement operations that occur after the syntactic derivation, in the PF component, within the framework of Distributed Morphology.The theory is an extension of what was called Morphological Merger in Marantz 1984 and subsequent work. A primary result is that the locality properties of a Merger operation are determined by the stage in the derivation at which the operation takes place: specifically, Merger that takes place before Vocabulary Insertion, on hierarchical structures, differs from Merger that takes place post-Vocabulary Insertion/linearization. Specific predictions of the model are tested in numerous case studies.Analyses showing the interaction of syntactic movement, PF movement, and rescue operations are provided as well, including a treatment of English do-support.",0
"In this paper, I explore a grammatical architecture in which morphology applies to the output of the syntactic component (cf. Halle and Marantz 1993; Marantz 1997). Morphologically complex words, on this view, reflect properties of syntactic structure, which includes argument-structure information. The argument proceeds from an examination of Kannada ""valency-changing"" morphology, revealing that lexical properties alone cannot explain the distribution of the reflexive and causative morphemes. The analysis builds upon the conclusion of Lidz (1996, 2001c) that the Kannada ""verbal reflexive"" is best understood with respect to its relationship to causativity and not as a marker of semantic reflexivity. Moreover, given certain independently motivated assumptions about the representation of anaphora, Kannada reflexive morphology provides an argument that the morphological component takes syntactic representations as input and hence that morphological structure is an interpretation of syntactic structure, not the input to it. The resultant theory is one in which the morphological component determines, after some amount of syntactic computation, how a given syntactic representation should be pronounced. Simply put, lexical insertion applies late in the derivation, possibly at LF.",0
"This paper examines two issues concerning the status of the form ""don't"" when used with 3sg subjects in child English, e.g. ""It don't fit"": 

1) Do children know that ""don't"" consists of an auxiliary plus a negative, or do they misanalyze it as pure negation? 

2) If they represent ""don't"" bimorphemically, what grammatical features underlie the auxiliary portion? 

Numerous accounts have proposed that ""don't"" is first misanalyzed as Neg, predicting that it should appear (ungrammatically) in environments where not appears; the results falsify this. If ""don't"" contains Aux, why does it fail to agree? Guasti and Rizzi (2001) appeal to a misset parameter involving spell-out. I demonstrate that their proposal makes incorrect empirical predictions for a subset of children, e.g. nonagreeing ""do"" is not found without ""n't"". An underspecification approach to root/optional Infinitives based in Distributed Morphology better captures these facts by treating 3sg ""do"" when followed by ""n't"" as inserted purely to support the clitic.",0
"This paper examines and evaluates what may be called the ""Rich Agreement Hypothesis"" (RAH) in the domain of verb movement asymmetries. The most prominent current accounts (e.g., Rohrbacher 1999) require inspection of the internal make-up of paradigms and take overt morphological variation to be the cause of syntactic variation. These proposals are shown here to be empirically untenable on the basis of evidence from dialect comparisons, diachronic changes, speaker variation, language-internal differences among constructions and acquisition data. In all cases, we find syntactic variation attested in the absence of corresponding morphological variation. Proposed weakenings of the RAH (drawing only a one-way implication from rich morphology to verb movement) are shown to be inconsistent with the morphology-driven approaches they claim to instantiate, or at best, incomplete. It is also noted that approaches relying on the overt marking of contrasts within a paradigm stand in conflict with results of current morphological theory. An alternative is considered that overcomes these problems. It is recognized that there are correlations between syntactic variation and morphological variation which do stand to empirical verification, and are thus to be explained. The particular correlations that are attested (and the attested domain of indeterminacy) follow from a theory which takes morphology to be not the cause, but rather a reflection, of syntactic structure, in line with standard theorizing in morphology.",0
"This paper investigates the configurations in which one morpheme (or the features it expresses) may serve as the context triggering allomorphy of another morpheme. It is argued, in part contra Carstairs 1987, that a given morpheme may be sensitive either inwards or outwards (i.e., to a morpheme closer to or farther from the root), but that the different directions reflect sensitivity to different types of morphological features, particularly among non-adjacent morphemes. Special attention is paid to allomorphy in the highly complex agreement systems of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages. Finally, it is shown that the particular constellation of asymmetries in the allomorphy investigated follows straightforwardly from certain assumptions about the architecture of the grammar and the nature of morphology, key among which being (i) separation/late-insertion: the phonological strings we call affixes are reflections of prior, abstract derivations- morphology interprets syntactic structures, rather than feeding them, (ii) cyclicity: that this interpretive procedure (vocabulary insertion) proceeds root-outwards, and (iii) rewriting: that as morphosyntactic features are expressed by vocabulary items, those features are used up and no longer a part of the representation.",0
"In this paper we explore the consequences of Grammatical Downsizing. Grammatical Downsizing occurs when the rules of morphology, phonology or syntax cause a given formative to be ill-formed in a certain context. We demonstrate with examples from Kannada and Modern Greek that Grammatical Downsizing leads to an extension of the semantic domain of some other formative, redistributing the semantic resources of the grammar onto fewer forms. The central question of this paper is whether the grammar requires a dedicated mechanism of Semantic Redistribution or if the effects of redistribution arise from the interaction of independent principles.",0

"And he taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels, saying:

inform me of the names of these, if ye are truthful (The Holy Quran, Sourat

Albagarah, Ayah 31)

Before they can add 2+2, children are conjoining sentences, asking questions,

selecting appropriate pronouns, negating sentences and using the phonological,

morphological, syntactic and semantic rules of language. Yet, children are not

taught language as they are taught arithmetic. Children learn many things as they

are developing from infancy to maturity, but they learn these things in different

ways.

A normal human being can go through life without having learned to read or

write. Millions of people in the world today prove this. However, these same

millions all speak and understand and can discuss complex and abstract ideas as

well as literate speakers can. Thus learning a language and learning to read are

somehow different. Similarly, millions of humans grow to maturity without ever

having learned algebra or chemistry or how to use a typewriter. They must in

some sense be taught these skills or systems, but they do not have to be taught to

walk or talk. Language learning is largely from the inside out rather than

being outside in (Gleitman, 1993:28).",0
"This article investigates scope interactions and LF positions of subject and object DPs in Turkish. It presents evidence indicating that case marked object DPs escape the scope of quantifiers in Turkish and consequently, challenging former accounts on the issue (Diesing 1992, Stowell & Beghelli 1994, 1997).   In section (1&2), facts about Turkish definites and specifics are given. In (3) data relevant to the topic and the problems the data pose for Diesing (1992) and Stowell & Beghelli (1997) are presented. In section (4), generalizations on the data and alternative analyses are discussed. The conclusions reached are these: (i) the so called ""weak determiner"" bir is in fact a numeral quantifier and should be classified as G(roup)denoting QPs in Turkish; (ii) The universal quantifier bütün/all does not have a distributive force and needs to be distinguished from the universal quantifier every/her which has a distributive force; (iii) Stowell & Beghelli's (1997) claim that QPs move to projections of their own to take scope may be accomodated to account for the subject QP and object DP constructions but constructions where both the subject and the object are QPs contradict their claim; (iv)quantifiers take scope at their syntactic positions in Turkish; (v) any overt case morpheme, be it structural or inherent, has the semantic property of allowing the noun to escape the scope of higher QPs.",0
"Sections 1 and 2 briefly outline some central features of mirror theory (Brody 1997) and discuss consequences with respect to basic word order. In sections 3 and 4 I note that mirror theory is incompatible with covert roll-up head chain type relations and argue that contrary to recent claims the analysis of Romance restructuring need not involve such structures. In section 5 I note that Kaynes correlation between null subjects and clitic climbing may be better captured under the proposed analysis than it has been in earlier approaches. I argue that both phenomena involve licensing of a spec by an element of Infl. In section 6 I discuss some aspects of the behavior of Hungarian restructuring infinitives and their treatment in mirror theory. Section 7 looks at some similarities and differences between the climbing  options of Hungarian verbal modifiers and Romance clitics. Finally in section 8 I argue that to understand Hungarian restructuring constructions it is necessary to distinguish (strictly local) head chain and (successive step) phrasal chain type relations, -- a fact that constitutes further evidence for some core assumptions of mirror theory.",0
"The so-called ""preposed article"" (PA) is a functional morpheme that plays a central role in the morphosyntax of Albanian DPs but is poorly understood theoretically. In this paper I present an analysis of PAs morphology along the lines of Distributed Morphology (DM; Halle and Marantz, 1993). PA is taken to be a post-syntactically inserted agreement morpheme. It is argued that a correct account of the insertion contexts of PA and of its allomorphy presupposes reference to surface syntactic configurations thus supporting the conceptual framework of DM. The claim that PA is in certain instances a constitutive element of word formation (cf. e.g. Buchholz and Fiedler, 1987) is rejected.",0
"Recent theoretical attention to Algonquian languages reflects new interest in how morphology connects with syntax. In different ways, Anderson (1992), Halle & Marantz (1993) and Steele (1995) analyze Algonquian morphology in terms of non-syntactic word-formation; all use data presented by Hockett (1939, 1948, 1966). While Hockett concentrated on Potawatomi, in later work he tried to construct a descriptive framework for Algonquian as a whole-notably in his 1966 paper ""What Algonquian is really like"". As he hints (1966:67 fn. 14a), Algonquian languages differ morphologically in some respects. The variation poses a test for the generality of particular analyses, and in this way helps us to evaluate the need to postulate a morphological engine distinct from syntax.

Placing data from Blackfoot, Plains Cree and Ojibwe beside Hockett's Potawatomi, I argue that the range of morphological variation in Algonquian is amenable to syntactic analysis, and that it poses problems for a-syntactic treatments. §1 reviews Hockett's notion of ""entity"", and §2 motivates a syntax for certain ""one-referent"" forms-the independent pronouns. §3 draws implications for the representation of agreement, and §4 extends the account to complex inflected forms (possess nouns and transitive verbs), arguing that they have three clitic-agreement positions. §5 concludes by comparing this analysis of Algonquian with a recent syntactically-based treatment of inflectional structure in Italian (Manzini & Savoia 1998).",0
"Distributed Morphology (DM) as presented in Halle & Marantz (1993) shows a bewildering variety of rule types. In this paper I present a formalization of DM in which the main part of its rule inventory is reduced to one single operation: Vocabulary Insertion.

I show that this interpretation gives rise to simple algorithms for the generation and parsing of DM expressions.",0
"Study of the prefix mis- attached to a verb. Whereas mis- always translates as ""the wrong way"", not all propositions with the wrong way translate with misV. There are syntactic (mis- fills the modifier position of a complex transitive structure)and semantic (the direct object follows internalized rules)conditions on the base verb. The translation of mis- as ""the wrong way"" is analyzed as ""the"" corresponding to presupposition (of an expected endpoint), ""wrong"" to the fact that this endpoint has been missed, and ""way"", to the role of mis- as a (direct object) modifier.",0
"Helke (1973), Pica (1987), Iatridou (1988), Safir (1996) and others have emphasized the importance of the internal structure of reflexives of the English 'himself' type and the Italian 'se stesso' type. That line of thought can be extended to the apparently monomorphemic non-clitic reflexives found in French and Italian (and many other European languages). More specifically, French 'soi' and Italian 'sé' are themselves bimorphemic.
In addition, 'soi' and 'sé' form a natural class with (French) 'moi/toi' and (Italian) 'me/te', the first and second person singular non-clitic pronouns. The person morphemes 'm-/t-/s-' themselves are arguably not intrinsically 'singular'. This is certainly true of reflexive 's-', and perhaps even of 'm-' and 't-'.",0

"In this paper, I will provide evidence that syntactic heads are  lled with phonological content after the application of syntactic transformations. The question of whether syntax precedes or follows morphology in a derivational grammar divides morphological theories into two classes: lexicalist theories assume that morphology precedes syntax; late insertion theories assume the opposite order. In principle hybrid theories assuming late insertion in some case, early insertion in others would also be possible, but the two extreme views are simplest and hence conceptually preferred. Therefore, arguments against one of the extremes, are arguments in favor of the other extreme. I provide two arguments again st the pure version of the lexicalist theory in sections 1 and 2. In section 3, I will present an argument in favor of late insertion.",0
"The topic of this paper is the manner in which syntactic voice alternations (and syntactic configurations more generally) relate to voice morphology, and the implications of this for theories of voice and theories of morphology/syntax interactions. I argue based on the voice system of Modern Greek for three primary points: first, that treatments taking voice morphology as corresponding to a syntactic argument of the verb (see references below) will not work for voice systems like Greek; second, that voice morphology in Greek must be analyzed as related to a morphological feature which is added post-syntactically in specific syntactic configurations; and, third, that this analysis has consequences for the study of syntax/morphology interactions more generally. These points and their implications are discussed within the context of the theory of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz (1993) and related work.) In order to establish these points certain sets of theoretical background assumptions must be highlighted; in the following paragraphs I review the major points of this discussion and provide an overview of previous theoretical treatments.",0
"In English, the third person plural pronouns they, them, their, theirs, themself, and themselves can be anaphoric to a grammatically singular antecedent, that is, a noun phrase which has singular verb agreement. The use of what is called singular they has puzzled grammarians since at least the 19th century, since agreement rules appear to be violated (Visser, 1963; Bodine, 1975). Often, singular they is assumed to be a pragmatic strategy for avoiding one of the gender-marked singular pronouns, he or she (e.g., Corbett, 1991). In this study I propose that singular they, while useful as an evasive form, exists independently in the grammar of present-day English, as it has from Middle English on. Singular they can appear in any form, in any structural relationship to an antecedent which describes or quantifies humans (or sometimes animals). Certain types of antecedents appear more often with singular they and are accepted by more native speakers, in the following semantic hierarchy: universal quantifiers, existential quantifiers, indefinite noun phrases, definite noun phrases (cf. Newman, in press; Parker, 1983; Whitley, 1978). Antecedents of singular they can be of any kind, including those where gender is overt or implied, except names. In addition, singular they cannot be used with pointing (deixis), providing support for a theory of reference where only names and deictics are referential (Russell, 1919; Neale, 1990). Antecedents which indicate gender are restricted to those which do not introduce a discourse referent, a noun phrase which can be referred to by a pronoun later in the discourse (Karttunen, 1976). Agreement rules are not violated if the concept of 'plural' is understood as indicating lack of precise number or identity, rather than 'more than one'. Singular they is then often the best choice with animate nonreferential antecedents.",0
"In this 1997 article I argued that locative phrases in many Bantu languages are headed by silent PLACE nouns meaning roughly INSIDE, SURFACE, and VICINITY. The approach was based on several factors: (i) locative phrases can appear in argument positions and control verbal agreement, (ii) they can contain expressions bearing locative concord and modifying PLACE noun semantic content, but nonetheless (iii) the overt locative markers (commonly ku, pa, and mu) fail diagnostics for nominal status.

I argued that ku, pa, and mu are gender-particular Case-markers akin to 'of' and other items commonly referred to as linkers, thus answering a question recently raised in Caha & Pantcheva 2014 as to why the hypothetical silent PLACE nouns in such analyses do not trigger the presence of linkers.

My analysis built on a proposal in my 1991 dissertation that so-called secondary prefixes in Bantu are noun class morphology for other silent nominal elements. For example, the Chichewa ka-mu-nda/ti-mi-nda – 'little field/s' bear two prefixes because ka- and ti- are number prefixes for a silent diminutive noun of a particular gender (see also Taraldsen 2013) while the inner prefixes mark the number of the diminutivized nouns. But locative class ""prefixes"" differ from other secondary prefixes in that, at least in some Bantu languages, they exhibit behavior characteristic of independent words (see Bresnan & Mchombo 1995). This difference is reflected in the account of the locative morphemes that I provide.

This is a 1996 paper illustrating how the tripartition of pronouns into clitic < weak < strong from Cardinaletti & Starke 1993/1999 applies to Germanic.,0
"I argue for the necessity of Halpern's (1992) proposed operation of Prosodic Inversion (PI), which can re-order a clitic and a potential host word in order to satisfy the clitic's need for a host in a particular direction. In Serbo-Croatian, this will allow enclitics that are clause-initial at S-structure to surface encliticized to the first prosodic word of the clause. Thus, at least some instances of 'second word' placement are not due to the syntax. However, all instances of 'second constituent' placement where the initial constituent is larger than one prosodic word are due to syntactic fronting across the fixed position of the clitics. I suggest that clitics are in Comp1 at S-structure, so that XPs that move to Spec-CP or heads that move to C0 are potential hosts for the clitics, but neither of these movements is obligatory. I propose that the level of Morphological Structure (Halle & Marantz 1993) is where lexical insertion takes place, including insertion of clitics, and that at this point a template based on morpho-syntactic features determines the order among the clitics under C0. At this point, the clitic cluster becomes a morphological constituent, taking on the prosodic subcategorization frame of each of its member elements, i.e. the need for a host word to the left. After morphological operations are complete, the S-structure tree as modified by the morphology is subject to a process of prosodic mapping that derives a hierarchical prosodic structure for the sentence from its syntactic structure; it is the resulting prosodic structure that is subsequently input to the postlexical phonology. I argue that prosodic mapping must crucially happen in two stages, the first a blind application of constituent-forming rules sensitive only to syntactic boundaries, the second a repair phase that modifies the output of the first based on prosodic requirements of the language. I claim that PI is part of this second stage, repairing sentences wherein clitics are unlicensed due to the lack of a host by performing the minimal change needed to license them, namely inverting the linear order of the clitic cluster and the following prosodic word.",0
"In this paper, it is argued that the defective and allomorphic nature of the copula (BE) is not a historical accident but derives from synchronic morphosyntactic principles. First a comparative generalization is made between the suppletive nature of the participle  of BE and its own auxiliary selection in perfect tense. It is either HAVE + BE.ptc or BE + WS.ptc, not BE + BE.ptc. (WS is an the allomoprhic root). This is derived from the Binding Theory under the assumption that BE carries an index, whose lexicalization is either pronominal or anaphoric. WS, the anaphoric root, is  composed of a pronominal part and a morpheme, just like 'zichzelf' in Dutch and 'himself' in English. A parallel is made between SE and BE.
